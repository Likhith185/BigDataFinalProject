although overall pattern table tends suggest two subscales relate differentially turnover types measuresas operating expense absence instances statistically significant findings dictates caution drawing conclusions discussion this research designed find systematic relationships members commitment work organizations several indices organizational effectiveness the results rather mixed the pattern relations hips hown table two commitment subscales perhaps provides one clue overall commitmenteffectiveness relationships strong anticipated although none relationships statistically significant two operating expense ratios showed tendency toward stronger associa tion value commitment commitment stay whereas turnover measures clearly related commitment stay this pattern suggests impact employee commitment organization may indeed depend specific kinds behaviors employees committed and course effects behaviors organizational outcomes in keeping earlier research porter et al steers koch steers clearest evidence provided present study inverse relationship organizational commitment employee turnover as steers pointed out finding surprising considering porters definition commitment porter et al however strong desire remain member ones organization automatically imply also intention dependable hardworking employee in terms harris eoyangs typology organizational outcomes would probably vary depending quadrant includes preponderance employees whoare position influence performance organization for instance employees strong intention remain low motivation contribute best efforts toward mission ie passive commitment would reason expect simple linear relationship organizational commitment overall organizational effectivenessparticu larly cases turnover appears little direct impact aspects organizational performance as table indicates turnover measures appeared virtually unrelated it acknowledged significance difference two correlation coefficients neither statistically significant difficult interpret how ever fact correlation could occurred chance mean correlation equals zero in instance larger pair correlations related operating expense nearly significant furthermore test forthe equallty two dependent correlations takes intoaccount simultaneously size correlation degrees freedom accordingly appears justtfication reporting statistical significance found on hand issue controversial data offered due caution organizational commitment effectiveness operating costs probable reasons discussed earlier paper perry angle the overall pattern table seems consistent harris eoyangs notion commitment stay commit ment work independent constructs and combination complex implications organlzatlons however table shows fewer statistically significant relationships might desired anomalies for instance although significant difference correla tions employeeperceived adaptability two com mitment subscales trend is counterintuitive direction indeed largest correlation table employeeperceived adaptability commitment stay it would seem unlikely linear relationship exist betweenany form commitment organizational adaptabil ity at extreme commitment would appear milltate individuals and therefore organizations ability adapt change salancik it likely that respect adaptability optimal level commit ment sufficient evoke needed employee behaviors be yond expliclt role stipulations strong incur suspension individual judgment in favor organizational precepts as additional note number nonsignificant relation ships table recognized study represents attempt find systematic relationships noisy system as often case field research number uncontrolled variables in particular performance measures operating expense ratios subject many influences besides motivation lowerlevel employees management competence structural technological variables various contextual factors combine place limits potential effortperformance relationship two cautions required the first crosssectional nature research to extent table show relationships commitment indicators organiza tional effectiveness directionality causal arrow still established for example however logical case might made optimal level employee commit ment might foster organizational adaptability possibility organizations adaptable either induce commitment members tend attract retain disproportionate share committed types employees the second caution occupational specificity as salan cik pointed out impact employee commitment organization depends employees committed do also potential specific behaviors influence organizational outcomes in present research example commitment stay shown clearcut relationship voluntary turnover indicators operating costs this may reflect ready availability replacement labor pool relatively modest training costs transit industry in industry laborpool technological considerations would combine make turnover particularly expensive commitment stay might exert powerful impact operating costs though indirectly conclusion the present research offered opportunity uncover commitmentperformance relationship relationship exists crossorganizational comparison commit ment levels relative performance measures within single type service organization furthermore reasons expect role bus operator behaviorperformance link might indeed exist what research clearly accomplished construc tive replication relatively large body earlier work showing definite negative relationship organizational com mitment voluntary turnover beyond issue results rather mixed the statistics could nearly considered bottomline indicators fort organizations participated research two operating expense ratios yet aspects organizational performance significantly associated organizational commitment although employeeperceived organizational adaptability associated commitment managerperceived adaptability not the relationship tardiness commitment significant however employee tardiness rate significantly associated organizational operating costs the overall pattern relationships various perform ance indicators two commitment
