partner ship either academic policy literature different writers tend adopt different definitions emphasize potentially different elements dimensions partnership woodworth meek marchington taylor ramsey moreover existing conceptualizations fail provide clear picture actual practices characterize partner ship systems specific principles might underpin them either explicitly implicitly though approaches partnership draw upon rooted informed by one three broad intellectual traditions theoretical perspectives for ease presentation label pluralist unitarist hybrid perspectives approaches partnership below briefly outline three perspectives basis gaining fuller understanding potential meaning partnership different elements dimensions might involve the first approach firmly rooted pluralist perspective it closely linked draws debates employee representation europe roots concepts industrial democracy ide workers participation acknowledge pluralist perspective provis within perspective clear acknowledgement differ blackwell publishers ltdlondon school economics partnership work ences interest capital labour by implication capital wish restrict power labour consequence power likely redistribution surplus value partly recognition this legislative framework provides basis widely described codetermination in developed form legislation provides clearly set rights codetermination consultation communication ide on europeanwide level clearest exemp lification pluralist approach probably found legislation social chapter european works council directive companies operating across number european countries germany key feature pluralist approach use representative system often though necessarily involving trade union representatives often involving directly elected representatives rogers streeck the emphasis words various forms indirect par ticipation designed use representatives safeguard ensure independent employee voice within enterprise this suggest direct forms worker participation employee takes decisions related aspects work strauss com pletely ignored within pluralist perspective as noted sisson however employers generally interested pur suing direct participation often linking it shall see below unitarist perspective partnership by contrast primary focus pluralist approach reflected main thrust european legislation area representative systems especially works councils issues might must discussed within systems in context term partnership already widely used europe in ireland example partnership irish government national agreement government employers trade unions operated successfully several years replaced new partnership agreement furthermore european union long endorsed concept social partnership commissions dg green paper partnership new organisation work european commission partnership presented end itself rather means end the second approach partnership roots unitarist framework explicitly seeks integrate employer employee interests time maximizing employee involvement commitment organization different strands distinguished within unitarist perspective depending specific policies practices empha sized part approach partnership one prominent strand instance focuses financial incentives shared ownership main mechanisms aligning integrating employer employee interests within enterprise within tradition emphasis primarily use various forms profitsharing share ownership designed give employee opportunity acquire financial stake company blinder conte svejnar blackwell publishers ltdlondon school economics british journal industrial relations second strand contrast focuses primarily various forms direct employee participation involvement daytoday work activities this approach places much emphasis individual employee contribution based assumption employee interests best met providing scope take decisions concerning issues expert namely related daytoday work how ever range topics dealt direct participation typically restricted job rather wider employment issues strauss within perspective employers often tend permit greater autonomy long maximizes workers contribution complemented communication programmes designed increase employee commitment organizations goals values ackers et al heller as result approach can practice signal reflect relatively low level trust partnership therefore runs risk rather one sided form partnership related much broader elaborate unitarist approach one clearly fully articulated recent main stream american organizational behaviour human resource manage ment literature this strand focuses maximizing might termed individual employees psychic stake organization reflected overall level attachment commitment involvement organiz ation and therefore goals values success pursuing these central approach emphasis systematic use full range variously referred progressive high performance highinvolvement human resource practices areas selection training job design communications appraisals rewards on designed maximize individualorganizational linkages generate high levels satisfaction commitment loyalty among workforce mowday et al beer et al walton lincoln kalleberg meyer allen pfeffer the third last major perspective partnership hybrid one combines elements two previous perspectives the hybrid approach based pluralist assumptions recognizes importance represen tative systems at time also recognizes importance direct forms employee involvement participation well benefits management employees working together ensure gains parties concerned within traditional industrial relations framework hybrid approach probably best exemplified mutual gains model writers kochan osterman employees individually representatives work management provide shared benefits job security increased flexibility produc tivity central mutual gains model hybrid approach generally idea that employee involvement initiatives thrive longer term progressive human resource practices fully effective require support formal joint governance system cutchergershenfeld et al applebaum batt implicit blackwell publishers ltdlondon school economics partnership work perspective therefore belief formalized representative arrangements necessary sustain key elements processes partnership perhaps prevent exploitation management the assumptions underlying hybrid mutual gains approach central much uks public policy debate partnership work debate also reflects important elements dominant pluralist unitarist perspectives outlined above thus successive conservative governments enthusiastically supported individualist marketbased ideology membership european union required make grudging accommodation elements european model

industrial relations perspective seminal work fox second key concept recurring theme mutuality idea focusing shared interests shared goals two interdependent parties recognizing potentially differing
