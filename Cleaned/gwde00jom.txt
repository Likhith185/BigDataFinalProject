examination data reveals corporate environmental initiatives indeed inﬂuence investors perceptions journal of management vol no gilley et al future economic performance after dividing total sample announcements processdriven versus productdriven environmental initiatives found sig niﬁcant differences anticipated future performance more speciﬁcally found investors reacted positively productdriven initiatives from reputation perspective one reason ﬁnding may processdriven environmental enhancements little increase ﬁrms perceived reputation stakeholders the investment community found less interested organizational process changes interested environmentally sound products services the potential reputation enhancing beneﬁts process driven initiatives realized translating negative market reaction however noted markets negative reaction processdriven environmental initiatives might occur despite potential marginal increases ﬁrm reputation could accompany them many types processdriven greening initiatives mandated government agencies may viewed punitive nature rather proactive steps taken ﬁrms improve compet itiveness thus negative market reaction may occur despite feelings marginal enhancements ﬁrm reputation may occur processdriven initiatives on contrary investors reactions indicate introduction envi ronmentally friendly new products changes environmental impact existing products may boost organizations reputations thereby enabling orga nizations achieve environmentally sustainable differentiation strategies shriv astava by enhancing environmental

practicing managers must understand environmental strategies created equally on contrary study indicates stock market reactions signiﬁcantly positive initiatives aimed reducing environmental impact ﬁrms goodsservices perhaps im provements organizational reputation accompany them therefore assuming investors reactions indicative ﬁrms future economic per formance managers seek reduce environmental

environmentally sensitive products may better use organizational resources environ mentrelated process changes by channeling resources environmental pro cess enhancements instead traditional value

production processes instead concentrate im proving environmental performance products services this say managers unconcerned environ mental impact processes on contrary results prior research

consequences associated ﬁrms environmentrelated decisions consequences may captured stock market reactions on hand possible investment community understand potential social consequences builds

indicate investors perceive value ﬁrms beginning environmental initiatives changes products also taking advantage processrelated spillovers occur in words ﬁndings may suggest market punish ﬁrms reduce
