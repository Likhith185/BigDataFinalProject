corporate social performance it gives score seven individual categories csr soundness fairness contribu tion society consumer protection environmental protection employee satisfaction contri bution economy we develop two proxies based keji index as explained footnote original keji index assigns different maximum scores different individual categories rather arbitrary thus converted original

obvious drawback assumes keji catego ries equally important stakeholders as discussed instrumental stakeholder theory firms different interests may need attend different stakeholders differently wood jones depending specific areas social responsibility considered important major stakeholders firms may exert different levels effort different categories social responsibility hence likely receive
