financial performance by including costefficiency performance measure asserting hr flexi bility positive relationship costefficiency cumulative direct indirect synergistic effects hr dimensions skill behavior hr prac tices we recognize scholars argued flexibility entails wider range resources less process routine may entail tradeoff efficiency actually increase costs lewis thompson weick to address assertion hr flexibilityefficiency relationship may differ hr flexibilityfinancial perfor mance relationship consider costefficiency part index firm performance measures separate measure allowing us specifically examine proposed relationship bhattacharya et al human resource flexibility employee skill flexibility firm financial performance skill flexibility generated two different ways first firms may employees possess set broadbased skills capable using different demand conditions broadbased skills valu able generate output streams existing requirements also capable producing output possible alternative requirements skills possessed employees currently used may open new opportunities business firm indeed may influ ence strategic choices lengnickhall lengnickhall second firms may employ wide variety specialist employees provide flexibility allowing firm recon figure skill profiles meet changing needs with flexibility need arises firm may reorganize employees eg project teams achieve desired skill profile fit changed demand neuman wright thus wide range employee skills contribute flexibility this wide range gained smaller number employees broadbased skills larger number employees narrow spe cialist skills broadbased skills complex difficult imitate refer wider array skills generated larger number diverse experiences at organizational level firms develop combination skills variety hr applications implement number years firm may develop skill flexibility processes job rota tion crossfunctional teams projectbased work arrangements generate broad skill configurations specific firm easily replicable this suggests higher level firms skill flexibility likely employees exhibit higher performance we hypothesize following hypothesis employee skill flexibility positively related firm financial performance employee behavior flexibility firm financial performance behavior flexibility capacity people adapt changing situations exhibit appropriate behavioral reper toires different situations lepine et al pulakos et al it distin guished skill flexibility sense employees may skilled lack behav ioral motivation change may highly motivated lack necessary skills knowledge make change decisions macduffie recent research suggests indi viduals differ capacity adapt change personality inventories may provide one method determining individuals level adaptability lepine et al thus firms enhance behavioral flexibility intentionally recruiting individuals exhibit higher levels adaptability behavior flexibility also involves greater tolerance nonroutine behavior part firm achieved fostering appro priate culture march therefore behavior flexibility develops period time behavior flexibility creates value two ways first individuals ability address dif ferent situations creates value organization spared costs nonadjustments changed situations adaptable individuals adjust complexities novelties changed situations lepine et al therefore losses associated lack change minimized second organizational level behavior flexibility valuable enables firm deal variety situations facilitates change implementation journal management august having employees enhanced learning capabilities means organization need hire new people new attributes address environmental changes there evidence behavioral flexibility organizational level contributes firm performance kotter heskett found study corporate culture perfor mance cultures emphasized adaptation changing environmental forces likely high performing garvin contended organizations superior learning defined creating acquiring transferring knowledge modifying behavior reflect new knowledge insights enhance performance see also baker sinkula hunt morgan recent empirical study finds support association learning organization concept firms financial performance ellinger ellinger yang howton on basis theory research propose following hypothesis employee behavior flexibility positively related firm financial performance hr practice flexibility firm financial performance hr practice flexibility creates value several ways first firm readily able adapt hr practices changed situations for example employee compensation plans based specific job descriptions may become institutionalized difficult change face likely employee resistance however variable compensation plan tied profit measures rather jobs adjusts rapidly increased decreased profits milkovich newman second flexibility hr practices may induce flexible employee behaviors in prior example variable compensation plans employees may adapt easily changed busi ness demands compensation determined successful firm changed scenario third hr practice flexibility allows firm offer similar hr practices across different unitsachieving strategic consistencywhile adapting parameters meet local concerns this facilitates reallocation reconfiguration employee skills for example may difficult rotate employees differences benefits across units at time every benefit may suitable way units if benefits parameters flexible eg cafeteria flexible benefits plan plans wide choice investment instruments may easier relocate people similarly hr practice appraising employees behavioral observation scales may difficult apply across organization nonuniformity behavioral expectations compared practice management objectives wright snell we argue firms develop hr practice flexibility create capability difficult imitate nonsubstitutable able respond dynamically environmental change these characteristics related competitive advantage and thus firm performance hypothesis hr practice flexibility positively related firm financial performance flexibility costefficiency although costefficiency part firm financial perfor mance merits separate analysis relation flexibility noted above debate exists bhattacharya et al human resource flexibility literature whether flexibility positively negatively related costefficiency adler goldoftas levine dean snell some researchers argue flexibil ity compatible lowcost strategies resources processes generate flexibility increase variety may also entail higher costs lewis parthasarthy sethi weick others contend flexibility efficiency necessarily two opposite ends one continuum corbett van wassenhove gibson birkinshaw high flexibility reduces cost obsolescence and helping firms react change may reduce costs delayed change missed opportunities we propose increased hr flexibility positively associated costefficiency we offer two justifications assertion first employee skill behavior hr practice flexibility reside people run control manage firms resources thus flexibilities may generate value may also facilitate synergies resources creating strategic opportunities for example firm able use skill flexibility quickly respond changed demand products services may also foster greater creativity innovation first mover advantages second reason hr flexibility associated costefficiency opportunity cost able adapt people high one reaction firms facing changing competitive environment downsize workforce sometimes dramatically employees maintain need hire new skills however research indicates tactic many possible negative effects including decreased morale remaining employees brockner grover reed dewitt omalley inability firm achieve longterm returns cascio young morris lower overall firm performance de meuse vanderheiden bergmann firm developed skill behavior hr practice flexibility conversely may able adapt environmental crises existing hr base overall assert firms exhibit increased employee skill employee behavior hr practice flexibility able avoid opportunity costs layoffs turnover therefore

although test longterm effects performance measures least partly collected flexibility measures further research explore degree dimensions hr flexibility related performance costefficiencies longer
