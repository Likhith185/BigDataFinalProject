jecolecon in developed country japan pressures resulted significant reductions air pollution last years oecd despite rapid economic growth period however data provided nihon keizai shimbun together results nakamura et al indicate patterns environmental management practices across japanese firms demonstrate considerable dif ferences some firms incorporated environmental goals heart decisionmaking processes others appear largely ignore environmental considerations minimum required legislation for example adoption voluntary practices iso certification promotion employee awareness environmental practices relatively patchy furthermore growing body literature suggests variation environmental man agement practices limited japan see eg gunning ham et al natural question ask therefore causes differences across firms this paper aims answer question employing japanese firmlevel dataset previously unused pur poses economic analysis identify quantify fac tors influence environmental

specifically make following contributions lit erature first examine extent range firm specific factors firm size profitability average age employees influences environmental management thus identify firmlevel characteristics appear encourage discourage adoption wide range environmental management practices second assess extent factors external firm may influence environmental management specifically ask whether forces globalization captured participation export markets undertaking foreign investment stimulates envir onmental management antiglobalization protestors clearly see environment victim free market forces although globalization may encourage absorption inno vative technology expose firm greater international monitoring generally perhaps via role media increase public visibility firm by assessing whether exposure globalization encourages discourages adop tion environmental management practices contribute wider globalization environment debate see eg antweiler et al neumayer cole elliott finally examine whether inherent pollution intensity industry firm belongs plays role determining extent environmental management practices adopted we therefore assess whether firms pollution intensive industries less likely sophisticated environmental man agement systems with regard previous literature theoretically sin clairdesgagné gabel demonstrate firms design environmental audits improve environmental management systems without adversely affecting activ ities drawing organisational management literature aragoncorrea sharma argue extent firms
