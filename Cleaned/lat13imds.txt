supply chain management performance institutional theory paper type research paper introduction environmental concerns inclusion green practices within supply chain subject become topical academic literature this interest mirrored increasing interest environment climate change efforts governments organizations around world minimize impact environment according sarkis integration environmental issues supply chain management scm become thriving subfield past two decades despite increasing popularity industrialized countries still several areas green supply chain management gscm require research particularly greening supply chain identified key issue sustainable scm large thomsen kenneth et al gscm also begun gain popularity emerging economy countries china malaysia for example eltayeb et al studied outcomes green supply chain initiatives among iso certified firms malaysia whereas zailani et al carried study gscm research malaysia analyze impact internal external forces environmental performance however studies context emerging economy countries including thailand still relatively rare hence study examines deployment green supply chain practices evaluates associated outcomes the motivation research threefold first although several studies examine relationships gscm practices organizational performance eltayeb et al sang et al dearth studies considered relationships within context organizational business strategy testa iraldo identified gap proposed need consider impact business strategy deployment gscm initiatives second studies zhu et al de giovanni vinzi green et al examined outcomes gscm within context tangible measures environmental operational economic performance consequently research intangible outcomes gscm practices limited eltayeb et al third manufacturing moves asia awareness green operations sustainability become important relevant studies asian countries many lin et al zhu sarkis arlbjørn luthje in particular within context south east asia gscm widely implemented links practices performance need identified need gscm research subregion rao rao holt this study also examines deployment gscm regulatory practices analyzes impact environmental economic intangible performance using business strategy control variable the dimensions business strategy considered low cost leadership quality timebased strategy the evaluation intangible performance includes perception measures internal employees external customers suppliers stakeholders this study therefore makes significant contribution ongoing research relate green practicesregulatory practices performance outcomes inclusion different set outcomes within context business strategy furthermore data collected developing country increasing global business presence little gscm research carried out literature review adoption gscm institutional theory perspective several organizational theories including resourcebased view transaction cost economics agency network theory institutional theory used understand companies adopt assimilate develop operations strategy initiatives total quality management anderson et al lean manufacturing ketokivi schroeder six sigma braunscheidel et al supply chain managementgreen supply chain management zhu et al zhu et al lee cheong zailani et al successfully within context gscm actors supply chain operate way fulfills customer legal requirements hence pressures government agencies nationalinternational regulators influence adoption environmentally responsible behavior delmas toffel rivera zailani et al narasimhan carter found companies institutionalized environmental practices pressure external internal forces well awareness consequences noncompliance environmental imperatives if companies legitimate concern environment social approval environmental practices deployed rapidly throughout supply chain carter et al there several studies carried developed countries show organizations driven institutional norms enhance competitive advantage adopting environmental practices gscm zhu et al sarkis et al reviewed number studies considered institutional theory key driver adopting gscm found companies mainly influenced external drivers these drivers include legislation regulation issued governments including applicability waste electronics electrical equipment weee august kyoto protocols clean development mechanism cdm climate change act in uk american clean energy bill usa restriction hazardous substance rohs july ii customer requirements sustainable packaging program walmart consumer electronics recycling program best buy zero carbon store program tesco leadership environmental performance toyota go green dealer program ford respectively research challenge identified study understand heterogeneous responses gscm implementation institutional pressures exist therefore theory still needs studied particularly emerging economy countries therefore proposed institutional norms emerging economy countries manufacturing outsourced ferdows different results previous studies conducted developed countries gscm practices it important note growth adoption green practices is part due effect institutional pressures driven market regulatory demands curkovic et al srivastava kumar putnam according zhu sarkis economic performance remains top priority manufacturers and particular developing economies not surprisingly several studies attempted link gscm practices organizational performance while studies zhu sarkis rao holt green et al found positive relationships environmental practices organizational performance studies giovanni vinzi huang et al showed significant relationship practices organizational performance yet studies including azevedo et al wu pagell found combination positive relationships the evidence literature therefore lack consensus impact gscm performance outcomes this conflict recognized discussed different studies including eltayeb et al zhu et al zhu et al argued conflicting findings potential become barrier organizations intend implement gscm based literature examined study suggests three plausible sources inconsistency first type green supply chain practices implemented impact performance differently azevedo et al secondly variety performance measures use variation leads complex relationship practices outcomes zhu et al lastly implementing gscm practices different settings result different performance outcomes koh et al in common findings murphy poist mentioned lack unified framework green practices this lack uniformity clear literature while studies diabat govindan argued gscm practices comprise green design reducing energy consumption reusingrecycling material packaging reverse logistics environmental collaboration supply chain others wu et al claimed green practices include cleaner production number patents internal service quality green design green purchasing green innovation zhu et al suggested green practices include sale excess inventory sale scrap used material environmental auditing programs commitment senior managers total quality environment management this study investigated impact proactive reactive practices implementation gscm these include proactive practice green purchasing practices ecodesign practices reverse logistics practices ii reactive practice legislation regulation also study separated ecodesign productrelated packaging related eco design practices the study categorized green performance measures environmental performance economic performance intangible performance included two control variables low cost business strategy qualitytimebased business strategy explain variation performance due firms strategic focus to increase reliability validity survey instrument multiple indicators used measure construct these measured items discussed next section green purchasing practices the adoption green purchasing one commonly accepted dimensions gscm practice according lee buying organization green supply chain initiative pay attention green practices suppliers especially small mediumsized enterprises in order ensure suppliers meet environmental objectives buying firm may deploy collaborationbased activities include training environmental information sharing joint research other organizations may adopt less collaborative approach simply demanding suppliers adopt environmental systems iso according herassaizarbitoria et al vachon external motivators particularly customer pressure key drivers adoption iso other aspects green purchasing discussed literature include facilitation recycling reuse resource reduction large thomsen diabat givindan there also evidence organizations adopt compliance evaluative approach gscm practices suppliers this involves evaluation suppliers based environmental criteria requirement suppliers develop maintain form environmental management system ems sarkis zhu et al large thomsen min galle ecodesign practices the importance ecodesign identified buyukozkan cifci revealed productrelated impacts environment influenced design ecodesign practices fall two main categories productrelated

provide lucrative economic benefits improve organizational competitiveness buyukozkan cifci murphy poist although influence reverse logistics greening supply chain significant development reverse logistics function typically lags aspects gscm xie breen moreover according lau wang development reverse logistics infant stage developing countries although countries increasingly responsible large proportion world manufacturing they stated studies reverse logistics carried developed countries reverse logistics practices identified previous studies include product returns remanufacturing olorunniwo li recovery recycling reuse field sroufe redistribution das these practices apply final products components das packaging material field sroufe furthermore perspective focal organization supply chain reverse logistics activities apply upstream downstream supply chain lau wang legislation regulatory practices the involvement governmental agencies regulatory bodies gscm well documented literature chung wee sheu noted effective green regulation incentive programs developed result government intervention several countries chen sheu went suggest relevant public policies central substantiating greening supply chain lu et al hitchcock noted legislation regulatory practices manifested different ways ppw weee rohs eup lu et al noted many organizations making efforts accelerate greening supply chain response stringent legislation regulation these efforts include proactively addressing environmental social concerns advance regulation zailani et al performance measures implementing gscm practices the house sustainable scm proposed teuteberg wittstruck identified three dimensions performance environmental economic social the study therefore differed others gscm performance studies focused primarily environmental operational economic performance zhu et al azevedo et al de giovanni vinzi green et al the importance social dimension gscm discussed literature primarily relation developed economies eltayeb et al argued intangible outcomes company image product image employee satisfaction customer loyalty satisfaction received much attention outcomes gscm despite studies testa iralado xie breen asserting gscm result improved brand image better relations stakeholders improved personnel motivation zailani et al measured social performance terms product image company image customers community stakeholders this study adopted performance measure intangible performance based eltayeb et al rather social performance proposed teuteberg wittstruck socioeconomic market conditions study aligned former based literature study measured intangible performance terms product image customer loyalty satisfaction company image suppliers customers employees the study also measured economic performance terms reduced cost increased profitability lin et al green et al environmental performance terms reduction air emission energy consumption hazardous material material usage compliance environmental standards zhu et al rao while relationship practices economic environmental performance developed economies extensively discussed literature azevedo et al xie breen relationships green practices intangible performance especially developing economy countries remains relatively unexplored business strategy this study examines intricate relationship green practices organizational performance within context business strategy adopted organizations this context given much attention previous studies even though studies alluded importance understanding role business strategy buyukozkan cifci suggested green supply chain evaluation needs make sense business perspective identified cost quality delivery flexibility key dimensions could considered testa iraldo also noted importance using environmental practices reflect organizations business strategy wu pagell wrote organizations need balance business model environmental issues several studies examined business strategies organizations basis competing respective markets cost quality reliability flexibility often identified competitive priorities many organizations kathuria ferdows de meyer ward duray boyer lewis with particular reference thailand study phusavat kanchana found quality important competitive priority manufacturers delivery also identified important competitive priority surprisingly however cost highly ranked competitive priority even though south east asian countries considered lowcost manufacturing countries this study considered low cost strategy quality timebased strategy relevant control variables research framework hypotheses the research framework associated hypotheses shown figure ____________________________ insert figure ____________________________ the authors believe implementation gscm practices potential impacts outcome variable may influenced organizational strategy according min galle adopting gscm practices involve setup costs organisation without significant financial resources may unable afford the implication organizations lowcost focused strategy may find difficult adopt gscm practices may impact outcomes achieved in addition costbased strategy organisation strategies also commonly focus quality time ward duray boyer lewis phusavat kanchana this study suggests strategies may also impact adoption gscm practices outcomes since practices cannot removed overall strategic direction organization the following set hypotheses argue firms business strategy significantly associated environmental economic intangible performance for example lowcost strategy precludes firm investing heavily environment improvement relationship negatively related it therefore proposed that lowcost business strategy inversely associated environmental performance lowcost business strategy inversely associated economic performance lowcost business strategy inversely associated intangible performance quality timebased business strategy positively associated environmental performance quality timebased business strategy positively associated economic performance quality timebased business strategy positively associated intangible performance the use performance outcomes evaluate gscm initiatives acknowledged previous studies zhu et al azevedo et al green et al according buyukozkan cifci important use environmental nonenvironmentalbased measures evaluate green supply chains this addition enabling greening supply chain initiative needs sensible viewed business perspective the potential impacts different gscm practices also discussed literature according kumar et al gscm practices provide potential cost savings improved efficiency attracting new suppliers customers they explained specific reasons adopting gscm practices included improved brand reputation compensating global warming increasing energy commodity prices well improved supply chain integration on basis earlier discussion performance measures literature section hypotheses study based three environmental nonenvironmental outcomes this study aims examine whether different green supply chain practices impact three dimensions outcomes identified for example according koh et al ecoproduct design implies effective use materials waste reduction reduction waste lead better costs organisation better use materials positively impact environmental performance ecodesigned products lead improved brand image similar argument applies ecopackaging design typified reusable recyclable packaging waste minimization means reduced packaging reduction elimination hazardous material packaging carter carter walker et al large thomsen buyukozkan cifci similarly regulatory practices typically involve reduction elimination hazardous materials products packaging well adoption recycling reuse environmentallyfriendly disposal lu et al hitchcock impact cost companybrand image environment the following set hypotheses argue gscm practices significantly predict level environmental economic intangible performance firm it is therefore proposed that green purchasing positive

manufacturers the fear legislation associated compliance environmental standards regulations clearly important driver organizations the authors believe defensive reactionary drivers practice performance the fact legislative regulatory drivers practices associated three dimensions performance confirm levels importance perceptive priority held thai manufacturers in contrast level adoption reverse logistics relatively low significantly associated dimensions performance there may indeed many varied reasons adoption reverse logistics low for example manufacturers may believe cost putting place reverse logistics infrastructure prohibitive compared gains foresee it may also possible that depending product reverse logistics seen impractical may well culture recycling deeply entrenched thai society thai manufacturers either failed recognize role recycling play improving performance decided ignore favor green supply chain practices study lau wang suggested reverse logistics adoption chinese electronics industry suffer lack enforceable laws prohibitive high cost investment low public awareness environmental protection this study would suggest factors may also applicable thailand in particular high priority given legislation regulation contrast reverse logistics product related ecodesign would suggest regulations motivate adoption latter two it would also suggest reactive approach green supply chain practices dominant proactive approach previous studies found link green supply chain practices financial performance also suggested processes reduce waste cut costs improve financial performance also improve environmental performance curkovic et al wu pagell it also suggested economic performance primary priority manufacturers developing countries zhu sarkis however fact thai manufacturers positively associate packaging related ecodesign legislation regulations economic performance suggests failure understand interlinked nature green supply chain practices practices productrelated ecodesign eg using recycled materials ensuring products recyclable reverse logistics impact environmental intangible performance also impact economic performance this interlinked nature also confirmed paper kumar et al furthermore disconnect high levels attainment intangible performance relatively high levels adoption green purchasing appears thai manufacturers recognized fully exploited positive impact green purchasing practices products corporate image the study also found significant positive relationships quality timebased strategy three dimensions performance significant relationships found low cost strategy dimensions performance the indication organizations choose lowcost strategy unlikely invest adoption green supply chain practices route improving performance clearly putting place infrastructure implement green practices would require resources may available lowcost organization may reflected product pricing thereby negating low cost strategy on hand organizations quality timebased strategy much likely link green supply chain practices strategy it argued example producing products using packaging recycledrecyclable avoids hazardous material requires certain level inherent quality development timefocused processes infrastructure facilitate logistics recycling conclusions managerial implications this study examined proactive reactive practices implementing green supply chain association performance among thai manufacturers it found legislation regulation regarded priority key driver environmental economic intangible performance reverse logistics relatively low adoption levels significantly linked dimensions performance the study also found manufacturers pursue low cost strategy less likely adopt green practices lead positive association three dimensions performance examined study conversely organizations adopt quality timebased strategy likely invest green supply chain practices lead significant positive association three dimensions performance the study also argued thai manufacturers appear failed understand potential link green supply chain practices dimensions performance it therefore suggested link properly understood prioritized manufacturers may place emphasis proactive green supply chain practices as opposed reactive practices driven legislation regulation thereby improve performance levels even more there clearly developmental issues still considered thai manufacturing industry within context green supply chain management this study significant managerial implications thai manufacturing industry potentially developing countries first thai manufacturers need understand potential positive impact green supply chain practices different dimensions performance consequently proactive adoption practices secondly countrys authorities need recognize impact legislation regulation actions manufacturers consider utilized enhance green supply chain practices eg recycling reuse products packaging thirdly organizations need aware pursuing low cost strategy may impact ability invest green supply chain practices precludes gaining associated benefits may leave vulnerable exposed future legislation regulations academically need understand missing links gscm practices dimensions performance considered study there also need examine infrastructure strategies reverse logistics
