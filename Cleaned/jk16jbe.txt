hypotheses ﬁrst considered methods ﬁrms may adopt improve organizational efﬁciency mobilize resources csr the majority literature mentioned performancebased pay one popular way organizations enhance organizational performance payforperformance monetary incentive pay system employee compensation related hj jung do kim job performance performancebased pay includes indi vidual meritpay gainsharing proﬁt sharing the number companies adopting payforperformance korea steadily increasing since late korean companies reported connect least part employees pay measures performance shin et al since

likely adopt payforperformance motivates employees material ie monetary in centives this ﬁnancial performance ﬁrms payforperformance superior ﬁrms without previous empirical studies support claim abowd delery doty lee et al origo for example origo using data italian metalworking ﬁrms found performancerelated pay contributed increases productivity range more speciﬁcally prior literature reported sig niﬁcant relationship csr incentivebased compensation falck heblich mahoney thorne also jones et al case study involving australian companies found extent ﬁrm involved csr directly correlated adopting performancebased wage system therefore safe assuming ﬁrms oriented csr in volvement likely adopt performancebased pay ﬁrms without csr involvement based rea soning previous empirical results formulated following hypothesis hypothesis the degree involvement csr positively related adoption performancebased pay we also believe ﬁrms csr activities likely adopt efﬁciencybased work practices ﬁrms seek recoup social costs improved productivity enhanced quality indeed one way re coup costs incurred socially responsible actions increase internal efﬁciency innovative work

these practices heightened employees morale satisfaction increased motivation involvements better communication turn leads heightened utilization previously untapped knowledge creativity within

exceed costs associated socially responsible ac tivity vitaliano stella empirical study using data banking industry also found ﬁrms adopted practices aimed maximizing internal efﬁciency offset costs socially responsible activity based evidence studies hypothesized ﬁrms engaged csr likely adopt efﬁciencybased work practices without csr hypothesis the degree involvement csr positively related

several case studies shown either csr employment unrelated deakin hobbs csr positively related employee reduction special situa tions benson overall believe ﬁrms good neighbors bad employers participating csr tend conservative employment policy others less likely ex perience employment growth hypothesis the degree involvement csr negatively related employment growth according zu song managers perceive csr ﬁnancial burden become involved csr activities ﬁrst examine ﬁnan cial situation when ﬁrm faces additional outlays csr avoid violating societal obligations likely concentrate proﬁtable practices also improve organizational efﬁciency reductions labor costs one way reduce labor costs seek numerical ﬂex ibility organizational restructuring one widely used practices achieve this in general restruc turing regarded sure way gain shortterm ﬁnancial savings facing ﬁnancial constraints thus opine ﬁrms csr likely restructure means cope csr expenses the previous literature supports proposition for instance bonvins case study switzerland de scribed ﬁrm involved csr hesitate lay employees short liquid assets vogel also found many global companies made social contributions developing countries expense employees job security parent country these studies suggest ﬁrms meeting external demands social activities may resort organizational re structuring minimize labor costs this view highlights positive association csr organizational re structuring externally socially responsible ﬁrms pursuit line reasoning leads following hypothesis hypothesis the degree involvement csr positively related organizational restructuring another means securing labor ﬂexibility usage contingent workers although contingent employment ar rangements criticized insecurity vul nerability employees use nonstandard forms employment may convey explicit advantages contempo rary corporations this contingent employment provides ﬁrms labor ﬂexibility typically lowering labor costs this labor arrangement confers ﬂexibility contingent workers easily terminated per manent employees enabling rapid adjustment labor re spond changes business conditions labor costs typically lower arrangement

matten moon as freeman stated ﬁrms seem suffer separation thesis separation fallacy disconnect business ethics case doing well doing good these ﬁndings imply participation corporate social activities

bad employer un dermining employment security employees the present study implied external csr activities internal csr activities may substitutive instead complementary relationship the present study suggests many cases employers commitment social issues go hand hand employee interests similarly attempts explain external csr activity often incompatible internal csr our ﬁndings im ply although ﬁrms
