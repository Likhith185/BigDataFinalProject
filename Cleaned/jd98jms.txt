journal management studies march performance implications of incorporating natural environmental issues into the strategic planning process an empirical assessment william judge jr thomas douglas university tennessee abstract this paper explores ability ﬁrms integrate critical strategic issue natural environment strategic planning process within natural resourcebased perspective using survey data collected wide variety ﬁrms industries based united states empirically examined antecedents eects integrating natural environment formal planning process these data analysed using structural equation modelling lisrel technique overall data provided strong support hypothesized relationships speciﬁcally found level integration environmental management concerns strategic planning process positively related ﬁnancial environmental performance furthermore found functional coverage resources provided environmental issues greater integration environmental issues planning process these results suggest concern environmental issues may yield competitive advan tages marketplace natural resourcebased perspective suggests greater introduction many ﬁrms discovered natural environment critically important strategic issue for example survey conducted boozallen hamilton showed per cent senior executives major companies issues extremely important company considered environmental newman breeden that major companies spend approximately per cent sales environmental consid erations similarly another recent survey large american manufacturers per cent respondents rated

wernerfelt the resourcebased perspective argues competitive advantage superior ﬁrm rents dependent unique assembly internal resources capabilities valuable rare imperfectly inimitable relative organizations competitors mitigate threats posed external environment barney blackwell publishers ltd incorporating natural environmental issues the resourcebased perspective generated productive dialogue among previously isolated perspectives conner mahoney pandian for instance powell used resource view ﬁrm clarify relation ship strategic planning performance evolved many years an interesting

stewardship sustainable develop ment increasingly sources competitive advantage he called perspec tive natural resourcebased view ﬁrm argued need expand considerations ﬁrm performance include environmental well ﬁnancial dimensions central argument natural resources increasingly constrained future ﬁrms better handle constraint command sustainable competitive advantage furthermore hart also theorized ﬁrms ability deal natural environment could developed organizational capability the capabilities organization refer ﬁrms capacity deploy resources usually combi nation using organizational

ﬁrms better developed capability issues strategic planning process yield superior ﬁnancial social outcomes recent work russo fouts suggests theoretical framework productive we examine level integration inﬂuences ﬁnancial environmental performance explore several antecedents may drive integration eort outcomes integrating natural environment strategic planning amit schoemaker distinguish organizational capabilities organizational resources this distinction important since many ﬁrms may possess certain ﬁnancial physical human resources ability combine resources using knowledge skills may render capabilities tacit andor socially complex potentially leading competitive advantage grant ramanujam et al described strategic planning processes multifaceted systems contextually embedded successful integration important external issue natural environment process viewed development capability deﬁned resourcebased perspective since planning process multiple desired ends ramanujam et al steiner ﬁnancial environmental outcomes addressed financial outcomes the strategic planning system consume many physical resources within ﬁrm consume considerable executive time blackwell publishers

using resource based perspective shown strategic planning system yield favour able performance outcomes existence within industry ubiquitous powell extending logic ﬁrms may able create competitive advantages incorporating natural environment strategic planning system better ﬁrms within industry fineman clarke ﬁnd ﬁrms often include environmental issues planning processes therefore important question concerns eect capability there two basic reasons support logic within management literature first environment signiﬁcantly threatening cost structure many businesses makower some increase cost derived growth complexity federal state environmental regulations these regulations increasingly raising standards environmental compliance and result requires correspondingly management attention capital technical resources address rising standards for example estimated pollution prevention equipment cost american businesses billion sullivan furthermore often real potential cost legal liability due environmental problems greeno robinson hunt auster an additional source cost due unnecessary waste because redesigning production systems reduce waste increasing interest green

ﬁrms reducing waste cost inﬂuencing suppliers buyers kirkpatrick in sum issues associated environment pose considerable external threat increasing numbers businesses impact cost business ﬁrms successfully responded issues gained competitive advantage second natural environment sometimes oers signiﬁcant new business opportunities cairncross for example ﬁrms discovering modifying inputs
