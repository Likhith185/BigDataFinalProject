complex coordination several human technical skills heterogeneous resources amit schoemaker order reduce environmental impacts simultaneously maintain increase ﬁrm competitiveness extant research

analysed natural resourcebased view literature predominantly based large ﬁrm samples eg arago ncorrea sharma christmann marcus geffen russo fouts sharma vredenburg our contribution study develop theoretical basis identify subset several capabilities discussed literature relevant likely smes developing proactive environ mental strategies shared vision the organizational capability shared vision exists organizations members collectively similar values beliefs objectives mission oswald et al the capability shared vision simply mean employees know managers objectives rather shared vision entails shared feeling ﬁrms objectives important appropriate members may contribute deﬁning them goal clarity shared responsibility organiza tional objectives two basic characteristics shared learning

necessary developing proactive environmental strategy earlier ﬁrms without capability strategies depend upon tacit skill develop ment employee involvement hart similarly research corporate environmental change argues importance employee support sme context barret murphy ruizquintanilla et al wehrmeyer parker although empirical evidence mainly based large ﬁrms context eg andersson bateman ramus steger on positive side compared large ﬁrms smes may burdened less bureaucracy fewer restrictions provide opportunities direct communication shared experiences amongst organiza tional

practices need pay careful attention stakeholders interests although small size provides ﬂexibility responding changes general business environment small ﬁrms also seriously challenged unfavourable hostile environments merz sauber external resources smes limited internal resources survive hostility external forces less likely large ﬁrms access media publicity therefore smes need organizational
