discussion we sought examine two interrelated research questions paper where capabilities come affect ﬁrm perfor mance we made three main arguments address ing questions first suggested capa bilities involve deployment resources evolve time joint effects deliberate persistent ﬁrmspeciﬁc investments learningbydoing second proposed capabilities contextspeciﬁc and therefore need conceptualize study accordingly in paper looked software services industry identiﬁed two important capabili ties project level clientspeciﬁc capabilities project management capabilities third argued improvement

sched ules stick them we believe study ﬁrm capabilities effects performance software services industry raises several important issues first study sought make case identifying capabilities sources performance differences need contextually the semielasticities coefﬁcients capabilities βxi βi measures computed mi variables ﬁxed means we avoid calculating semielasticities interaction terms the typically high correlations main effect interaction effect result imprecisely estimated coefﬁcients as result computing accurate economic signiﬁcance coefﬁcients becomes difﬁcult strat mgmt where do capabilities come from how do they matter it seems grounded each industry driven demand supplyside economics also changes time it important take account identifying measuring capabilities indeed signiﬁcant differences way ﬁrm deploys resources across projects time holding project inputs characteristics constant found improvement project management capabilities resulted increases project contribution put simply results demonstrate project proﬁtability differences could function differences way resources deployed ﬁrm also found evidence improvement productive deployment resources time yielded increases project proﬁtability this provides reason take seriously penroses key insight differential ﬁrm capabilities productively deploying resources lie heart ﬁrm performance differences second appears measuring capabilities micro levels within ﬁrm quite promis ing it helps better estimate eco nomic signiﬁcance also provides clear guide lines ﬁrm needs improve capabilities measures capabil ities aggregate ﬁrm level useful identifying betweenﬁrm differences provide lit tle understanding microfoundations interﬁrm differences as study demonstrates measurement ﬁrm capabilities micro level holds promise enhancing understand ing how why ﬁrms perform better others lastly analyses also show marginal returns different capabilities uniform given scarce managerial resources useful ﬁrms ﬁrst identify capabilities provide highest marginal returns performance direct bulk resources acquir ing them building capabilities requires signiﬁ cant and often irreversible commitment real resources ﬁnancial managerial deci sions capabilities acquire build require due diligence analysis costs beneﬁts moreover likely different ﬁrms face different costs beneﬁts acquiring capabilities given interdependencies various organizational choices ethi raj levinthal for instance ﬁrm engages relatively repeat projects copyright john wiley sons ltd marginal beneﬁt clientspeciﬁc capabilities likely signiﬁcantly less marginal beneﬁt project management capabilities this would generally case smaller newer ﬁrms likely fewer repeat clients early years the converse likely true case ﬁrm engages large number repeat projects in fact latter set ﬁrms could also explore feasibility investing creating deliberate institutionalized mecha nisms build clientspeciﬁc capabilities leaving tacit learningbydoing our inter views seem support contention finally dataset assume marginal cost acquiring different project management capa bilities same results suggest ﬁrm would well advised expend resources improve schedule estimation management capabilities tightly manage schedule slip pages improvements capability promise yield higher marginal improvement project con tribution performance

industry peculiar characteristics it clear extent substantive results paper generalizable across industries at time asserted above capa bilities usually contextspeciﬁc ie industry speciﬁc capabilities generalizable across industries likely overly abstract less useful guide managerial action second limitation study based data single ﬁrm ideally would liked include data ﬁrms however getting access
