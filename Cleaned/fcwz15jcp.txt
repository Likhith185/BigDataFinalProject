first emss adoption may help ﬁrms gain government support respond external pressures darnall et al as every ﬁrm adequate internal resources required emss imple mentation regulators usually provide

proactively ﬁrms also access regulators easily qualiﬁed participate switching cost competitive intensity environmental management systems financial performance fig conceptual model feng et al journal cleaner production governmentsponsored ems programs darnall edwards moreover ﬁrms likely establish greater external legitimacy corporate image responding institutional pressures protecting environment de bakker et al sroufe zhang et al because enhanced external legitimacy corporate image ﬁrms adopting emss beneﬁt charging premium price increased customer loyalty such corporate image intangible asset allows ﬁrms market emss selling points products thus differentiating products competitors bansal hunter darnall et al second according rbv ﬁrm emss strategic re sources help ﬁrm gain competitive advantage ach ieve better performance menguc ozanne russo fouts klassen whybark argued adopting emss may allow ﬁrms access unique resources capabilities firms sufﬁcient resources capabilities likely minimize environmental impacts in addition since emss encourage information sharing joint problem solving addressing environmental issues ﬁrms knowledgebased skills developed enhanced darnall et al by devel oping knowledgebased capitals ﬁrms achieve greater success reducing environmental protection costs christmann gaining advantage competitors winning customers lo et al vachon klassen finally emss may help ﬁrms gain competitive advantage providing cost savings opportunities yang et al sroufe emss encourage ﬁrms establish environmental planning throughout full range ﬁrms activities raw materials acquisition manufacture product distribution minimize lifecycle costs products develop new products lower lifecycle costs melnyk et al menguc ozanne found ﬁrms attempting reduce phys ical waste dispose physical waste environmental friendly ways may reduce costs improve proﬁtability recently wong et al suggested use reusable components parts extracted returned products offers cost saving opportunities ﬁrms hence propose following hypothesis there positive relationship emss ﬁnancial performance the moderating effect sc sc represents obstacle customers change product providers wathne et al crucial factor de termines competitiveness market environment jones et al sc deﬁned costs consumers pay process switching one product provider another anton et al yee et al when customers switch product providers need bear various costs ranging time spent searching evaluating potential alternatives learning operate new product building relationship new provider beneﬁts lost changing provider jones et al yee et al sc moderates effects emss ﬁrms ﬁnancial perfor mance due following logics if customer perceives sc low dissatisfaction ﬁrm motivate hisher intention switch product provider thus ﬁrms adopting emss may attract customers improve repeat purchase rate based superior public image green products however customer perceives sc high heshe may become less sensitive providers behaviors yee et al this potentially prohibit socially responsible ﬁrms intentionally make proﬁt due relatively ﬁxed supplierecustomer relationships friedl wagner since high sc discourages changing current provider thereby yielding less proﬁt incentive ﬁrms actively adopt emss therefore sc low rather high emss may lead greater performance therefore hypothesize sc negatively moderates relationship emss ﬁnancial performance the moderating effect ci ci another important factor determining competitiveness market environment reﬂects level competition among ﬁrms auh menguc tsai yang enhanced ci features greater competition among incumbents fewer opportunities growth auh menguc li et al when ci low ﬁrms operate existing systems take full advantage transparent predictability behavior auh menguc however intense competition force ﬁrms adapt operational strategies accordingly when competition intense ﬁrms need undertake proactive activities looking new ways compete exploring differentiation based eco friendly procedures products escape price promo tion wars we posit ci may also moderate relationship emss ﬁnancial performance three major reasons first differentiation likely mitigate potential threat compe tition tsai yang firms adopting emss likely build differentiation advantages bansal hunter darnall et al emss adoption may also increase customer loyalty improved ﬁrm image product quality thus ﬁrms imple menting emss capable winning price promotion wars second information processing theory suggests ﬁrms adopting emss favorable position since rapidly acquire interpret wide range competitor information utilize information develop creative responses environ mental issues tsai yang as competition intensiﬁes need gather analyze competitor information heated hence increased competition markets may place premium emss third rising global environmental concerns customers increasingly demanding ecofriendly products suppliers banerjee et al thus ﬁrm implement emss come new solutions reduce negative environmental impacts operations andor products performance effects emss even salient condition high rather low level ci chan et al based arguments predicted ci positively moderates relationship emss ﬁnancial performance the joint moderating effects sc ci in addition independent moderating effects sc ci may jointly moderate relationship emss ﬁnancial performance since customer switching market competition often coexist market may act together seiders et al two factors likely synergistic moder ating effect degree emss contribute ﬁnancial performance moreover environmental dynamism hostility may interactively inﬂuence effectiveness organizational strategic decisions luo park lee et al also suggested sc becomes important great feng et al journal cleaner production number alternative providers market we thus conjecture sc ci may interactively affect impact emss ﬁnancial performance in words moderating effect two factors likely dependent other furthermore separating impacts contingent factor may underestimate complex forms interaction may thus oversimplify actual situations emss inﬂuence ﬁnancial performance tsai yang in contrast considered simultaneously sc ci may yield inter pretable theoretically interesting pattern fac tors would show isolation rousseau fried from interactional perspective examine interaction sc ci affects performance effects emss an interactional perspective suggests combination sc ci form set market conditions according levels two variables different market conditions may different inﬂuences performance effects emss since four kinds different market conditions ie low high levels sc ci may generate different opportunities constraints challenges market strength relationship emss ﬁnancial performance may vary across market conditions at one extreme condition low sc high ci ﬁrms gain beneﬁt implementing emss if customers switch new provider low cost competitors begin price promotion wars rapidly ﬁrms likely realize maximum value emss adoption better take advantage customer switching provide products differentiated competitors at opposite extreme condition high sc low ci effect emss ﬁnancial performance diminishes when customer switching costly competition intense ﬁrms implementing emss may improve performance lesser degree therefore may less cost effective ﬁrm adopt emss conditions situated two extremes remaining two conditions ie low sc low ci high sc high ci may intermediate effect strength relationship emss ﬁnancial performance however studies investigated two factors stronger effect effectiveness organizational decisions in study suggest sc may greater inﬂuence performance effects emss attracting retaining cus tomers require innovative activities emss within ﬁrm whereas ci may always justify emss ﬁrms achieve competitive advantages approaches benner tushman tsai yang this speculation also supported henard szymanskis ﬁnding meeting customer needs greater impact new product performance competition does therefore conjecture emss may improve ﬁnancial performance larger degree con dition low sc low ci condition high sc high ci these arguments lead
