resource management performances zfp introduction in past human resource management hrm rarely mentioned factor performances lenz according survey carried fritz hrm today mentioned research papers concerned factors success moreover hrms contributions explanation gaps performance far marginal for instance analysis firms representative german industry fritz ibid noted that contrary hypothesis hrm choices better explain variability performances marketing decisions clearly increasing ability hrm explain gaps performances tied fact less less research contributions ignore variable one sources evolution traced analyses german japanese economic miracles indeed studies demonstrated performances german japanese firms partly due particular models industrial relations hrm hayesabernathy pascaleathos prais limprechthayes weiss maurice sorge consequently hrm considered today potential source competitive advantage fombrun devannatichy bairdmeshoulam barney wright mcmahanmcwilliams fact explain increasing interest hrm however empirical results concerning link hrm practices performances often contradictory nature for instance millermonge wagnergooding cotton et al traced several dozen studies conflicting conclusions effects employee participation job satisfaction performance hypothesis emerged explain conflicting conclusions this hypothesis leads distinguish two particular systems hrm the first system known control arthur technical huselid et al consists considering workers source costs minimized rosenquarrey kravetz hansenwernerfelt grinyer et al the second system known commitment arthur ibid strategic huselid et al ibid based perception people resource value develop motivate order achieve goals organization these two contrasting approaches described recently variety authors see example storey mahoneywatson guest tsui et al garnjostwächter but several empirical studies confirm superiority strategic system hrm obtain satisfacting performances mayerschoorman day contradictory conclusions equally obtained europe for instance germany one principal tools strategic perspective hrm comanagement appears ambivalent instrument indeed according gaugler co management positive influence performance thriving firms tends amplify difficulties firms going crisis likewise contrasting conclusions formulated germany impact employee profit sharing performance wächterkoch as french case research reyes garcia savallzardet liouvillebayad confirm hypothesis positive liouville bayad human resource management performances zfp impact strategic hrm performance whereas results allouchekrausz darcimoles schmidt lead similar conclusions thus aim clarifying question first part study presents theoretical model the second part discloses research methodology third part exposes empirical results obtained commented framework model the nonconvergence conclusions impact hrm systems performances partly due fact indicators considered always identical moreover different authors use indicator measurement mode indicator varies one study another leana et al in attempt resolve problem indicators testable model distinguishing several levels performance proposed the elaborated model depicts three levels performance the model based hypothesis existence links three levels see figure the presumed links following organizational performances dependent social performances turn

organizational performances in short model coherent works concluding motivation implication employees contribute efficiency firm côtésega gelinier kieserkubicek figure modelization impact hrm practices performances iz liouville bayad human resource management performances zfp the model allow test hrm practices brings social performance improvements turn positive influence organizational performances by way cascade effect economic performances also improved contributing thus greater competitiveness firm way investment policy de woot zahracovin in summary model contrasts traditional view link hrm economic performances the present model adheres socioeconomic view suggests direct interdependence hrm economic performances finally model must tested see corresponds reality results leading formulation recommendations management methodology selection construction variables so identify different hrm systems twelve items pooled derived variety sources including hornsbykurato osterman pfeffer arthur huselid et al this items allow make distinction practices reflect technical strategic perspectives hrm six items described strategic approach six items technical approach the strategic hrm variables are employee education training empowerment communication employee participation promoting personnel managing careers improving working conditions the technical hrm variables

results the focus smes due fact within large firms different groups implement human resource activities many factories this implies heteregeneous hrm practices may applied different parts firms snell

this implies particular ceo encouraged verify cognitive schemas phase reality perceived employees finally study suggests effectiveness hrm highest staff implements mixed system including technical strategic hrm activities highquality this conclusion means that opposition theoretical hypothesis arthur firms develop technical strategic hrm activities achieve higher performances this evidence may explain fact sample french smes firms generally compete environments characterized lower levels institutionalization technical hrm activities thus suggested huselid et al improvements field may means gain competitive advantage furthermore first assertion leads us consider contexts with low technical hrm firms may achieve least moderate practices technical hrm foundation needed implement strategic
