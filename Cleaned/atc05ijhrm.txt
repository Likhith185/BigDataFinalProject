importance understanding dominant models hrm country prior undertaking comparative hrm research boxall furthermore little attention paid examining extent strategic approach hrm adopted philippines while increasing interest status hrm asia paciﬁc region eg bae et al rowley benson studies tend focus countries philippines based review literature studies philippines tend casestudy based amante labour relations focused eg erickson et al kuruvilla despite growing literature ﬁeld international management surprisingly little known regarding adoption strategic hrm southeast asian ﬁrms especially

little empirical research understand ﬁrms filipino foreignowned adopt strategic hrm make competitive the main aim current study examine level uptake strategic approach hrm ﬁrms philippines extent related perceptions ﬁrms performances differences locally owned organizations hr ir processes also investigated the format paper follows ﬁrst brieﬂy review literature strategic hrm second outline research methodology finally ﬁndings reported together discussion theoretical practical implications strategic hrm ﬁrm performance philippines the nature hr ir management philippines characterized diverse range internal external environmental inﬂuences similar development hrm countries eg bae et al rowley benson ulrich people management function philippines began demonstrate features hrm selmer de leon skene amantes study showed filipino ﬁrms tend require personnel managers take active role strategic decisionmaking it also argued market competition transformed traditional functions personnel managers merely handling administrative functions recruitment discipline compensation employee welfare records role evolved one includes executive decisionmaking amante amante also showed many new bigger ﬁrms preferred use job title hr manager instead personnel manager recently others selmer de leon skene supported earlier ﬁndings amante providing additional empirical evidence supporting evolution personnel management hrm philippines human capital strategic hrm ﬁrm performance the relationship hr practices ﬁrm performance studied several theoretical perspectives adopting resourcebased view ﬁrm barney strategic hrm scholars such bae et al wright et al argued effective management hr important used sustain competitive advantage utilizing progressive innovative hrm ir practices crucial selecting developing motivating retaining requisite human capital becker huselid wright et al strategic hrm also examined using human capital perspective becker schultz youndt colleagues adopted conﬁgurational approach hrm delery doty concluded key mechanism harnessing human capital using appropriate hr practices enhance ﬁrm performance snell dean youndt et al speciﬁc examples hr practices used snell colleagues include selective stafﬁng training providing equitable rewards this skills knowledge abilities possessed hr provide economic value organizations snell dean found human capitalenhancing hr practices positively correlated adoption advanced manufacturing technologies similarly barney stated that increase productivity human capital ﬁrms need harness potential audea et al hrm professionals perceptions contribution employees this human capital must developed managed core competence ﬁrm employees treated source competitive advantage lado wilson posited decreased importance traditional sources competitive advantage led increased signiﬁcance human resources part organizations tangible resources potential continuous organizational success this consistent resourcebased theory ﬁrm argues organizations develop sustained competitive advantage activities create value unique way one competitors cannot copy barney wright et al drawing human capital resourcebased view perspectives hr practices used ensure skills knowledge abilities core employees transformed source competitive advantage eg arthur huselid wright et al past conceptual empirical research generally agrees importance certain hrm practices determination employee organization level performance arthur found hr practices related scrap rates productivity employee turnover huselid found substantial relationship employee turnover ﬁrm proﬁtability wright colleagues reviewed relationships various hr practices ﬁrm performance they found substantial support relationship hr practices ﬁrm performance speciﬁcally found appraisal training signiﬁcantly related workforce skills research also demonstrated higher levels human capital among employees ﬁrm result higher level productivity lee et al parnes snell dean delery doty argued organizations recognize adopt hr best practices always result greater organizational effectiveness moreover enhance performance hr practices synergistic effects consistency within conﬁguration hr practices hr practices strategy delery doty becker huselid reached similar conclusion arguing complementary hrm system understood examining clustering hr practices in studies becker huselid found empirical evidence support notion hrm system could lead better ﬁrm performance an hrm system increases organizational performance develops maximizes organizations abilities huselid contributes continuous competitive advantage the individuals working company become source basis utilization resources thus efﬁcient hrm system organizations employees become essentially strategic asset they form system resources rare abilities cannot easily copied replaced provides company competitive edge harel tzafrir the elements sound ir system also closely linked progressive hrm system erickson et al it shown industrial relations process important element hrm system philippines erickson et al kuruvilla skene as noted erickson colleagues the deﬁning characteristic filipino ir adversarial nature labourmanagement relations this adversarial nature rooted exceptionally legalistic approach permeates every institution ir system particular dispute settlement research philippines shown level unionization impact rate innovation verma et al ir practices labourmanagement councils tend implemented ﬁrms higher degree unionization with increasing focus export form industrialization filipino manufacturing industry adopted sophisticated the international journal human resource management hrir management practices such quality improvement employee involvement allow skill development automation manufacturing industry verma et al therefore expect perception adoption strategic hrm systems associated higher ﬁrm performance hypothesis firms adopt strategic approach hrm higher levels performance similarities differences hrm systems the issue whether hrmir practices converging diverging within regional cultural clusters continues focus recent studies mccaughey de cieri argue that organizations becoming similar macrolevel respect characteristics associated socioeconomic aspects organization eg structureenvironment contingencies organizations continue maintain culturally based dissimilarities microlevel due cultural differences impact upon outcomes hrmir practices eg hofstede convergence theorists assert cultural convergence driven rapid spread technology globalization international trade ﬁnance makes possible foreignowned ﬁrms apply relatively similar hrm practices across countries rowley benson gooderham et al increasing awareness leggett bamber argued historical structural factors philippines resulted convergence hrir management practices foreign local ﬁrms for instance due historical unrest labour

evidence support idea foreign local ﬁrms australia moving towards uptake strategic approach hrm other studies eg debrah et al de silva quibria standing wan et al demonstrated performance asian ﬁrms
