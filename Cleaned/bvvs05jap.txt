apply lgm second study found evidence linearly declining change ac nc time this supports brockner et al stated years ago may easier break rather build employees organizational commitment however much present study examine actual antecedents interpretations regarding causes declines speculations best not future research include potential antecedents also underlying brockner et al quote another broader issue namely increasing commitment across time important decreasing commitment it may case example people sensitive even minor decreases commitment comparable increases commitment the reverse may true well the point threshold point change causes difference behavior may smaller decreases increases vice versa additionally consequences changes may also different for example current study reasonable assume basis past research declining forms commitment would impact turnover process but would declining commitment necessarily impact per formance given even uncommitted people necessarily begin perform poorly fear losing job finding another alternative it may well case inrole extrarole citizenship performance behaviors influenced increases commitment our point though raising issues isolating actual change com mitment researchers may begin address refined questions regarding actual commitment process questions cannot addressed traditional research designs finally would worthwhile examine generalizability current findings the current sample university graduates relatively early stages profes sional careers the question is would observe similar out comes among less education working within less professionalized occupations much along career stages likewise would observe similar findings within cultures perhaps eastern cultures example relations highly emphasized would prone increases commitment across time commitment left devices current study even though tenure controlled current study implication underlying well question concerning career stages education professional nature occupation different mind sets driving commitment may arise ie professionals may driven relational bases commitment ac nc whereas less professional individuals may driven transactional bases hs la it would interesting examine whether decrease relational bases commit ment among commitment manifests behaviors perhaps changes transactional bases among less profes sionalized occupations in closing however point questions deal change and therefore process under lying commitment these questions fundamentally different addressed research designs relying static
