training possibly costs so although purpose paper explore average effects awps appear rather be thus clearly need investigate similar possibilities fully though subsequent analysis data study

diminishing even declining effects high levels awp in volvement it also possible use awps still spreading high levels adoption likely recent case observed negative effects levels may reflect initial disruptions uncertainty rather high levels adoption per se similar possible problem involves cau sality it possible employers likely introduce high levels awps work experience outcomes employees

possible implica tions awps workers depend institutional conditions adopted in particular would ex pect interests workers thoroughly incorporated imple mentation model unions strong workers enjoy
