likely repurchase firms good job handling returns nik ab halim nik abdullah sabariah yaakub theoretical framework and hypotheses development figure presents theoretical framework study it developed based previous study related reverse logistics adoption the model consists four independent variables namely financial competitive pressure customerstakeholder pressure regulatory pressure corporate citizenship pressure these four proposed factors expected directly impact dependent variable level reverse logistics adoption figure theoretical framework study financial competitive pressure demanding customers pressure regulatory pressure corporate citizenship pressure reverse logistics adoption level firms performance financial competitive pressure in order competitive firms days need innovate discover best competitive opportunities improve quality products methods order progress at time firms want sustain competitive advantage must earn trust customers could gained good return policy good return policy needs good reverse logistics programme the reality good reverse logistics programme differentiator provides means gaining market competitive advantage jayaraman luo rivalry firms global market days put pressure companies reduce costs implementation reverse logistics activities help firms becoming proficient handling returned goods it improve relationships along supply chain also reduces costs thus proficiency improves profits higher recovery rates reached stock previous studies found tendency intensity firms compete competitors market positively affects strategic business policies influence managers investment decisions grenadier innovation effort aghion et al creating firms marketing strategy porter therefore hypothesises that financial competitive pressure positively related level reverse logistics adoption reverse logistics pressure for adoption and the impact on firms performance demanding customerstakeholders pressure in present scenario growing concern environmental protection among consumers stakeholders shareholders government nongovernmental organisations ngos pressure groups firms expected enormous pressure implement reverse logistics customers even ready pay environmentalfriendly products casadesusmasanell et al vandermerwe oliff many options left companies go reverse logistics practices this requires proper disposal endoflife products otherwise negative impact environment this public concern environment taken problem must considered opportunities companies gain profit marketing green products implementation reverse logistics also requires liberal return policy customers often allowed return products reason this coupled need accommodate damaged defective merchandise product recalls maintenance repairs means logistics professionals must place higher priority effectively managing returns autry daugherty richey efficient aftersales services definitely increase consumers satisfaction shaharudin et al based argumentation hypothesises that demanding customerstakeholders pressure positively related level reverse logistics adoption regulatory pressure sustainable development environmental protection concerns among significant issues faced businesses days introduction new improved regulations relates product waste disposal may make mandatory companies recover used products produced accept back end useful life product regulations generally credited greatest influence firms reverse logistics activities carter ellram therefore companies expected focus reverse logistics operations environmental reasons rogers tibbenlembke european waste electrical electronic equipment weee directive introduced january example requires electrical electronic manufacturers comply scheme order trade europe scott the german packaging ordinance resulted companies working closely competitors put tough environmental policies practice cairncross packaging therefore returned mainly reusable sometimes legal regulations required disposed proper acceptable manner rogers tibbenlembke previous studies reveal firms practicing environmentallyfriendly programs trying avoid violating environmentalrelated regulations luken van rompaey hokey william as result third hypothesis study is regulatory pressure positively related level reverse logistics adoption nik ab halim nik abdullah sabariah yaakub corporate citizenship pressure firms days also huge pressure behave socially responsible manner usually known corporate citizenship pressure corporate citizenship extent businesses socially responsible meeting legal ethical economic responsibilities placed shareholders the aim businesses create higher standards living quality life communities operate still preserving profitability stakeholders as demand socially responsible corporations increases investors consumers employees willing use individual power punish companies share values for example investors find companys negative corporate citizenship practices could boycott products services refuse invest stock speak company among family friends investopedia corporate citizenship likely acknowledged businesses worthwhile investment activities clearly trigger consumers active support inasmuch corporate citizenship may desirable society whole unlikely widely embraced organizations unless yields concrete business benefits isabelle ferrell implementation reverse logistics activities way portray good corporate citizenship therefore hypothesises manufacturers implement increase current level reverse logistics adoption due corporate citizenship pressure thus fourth hypothesis study is corporate citizenship pressure positively related level reverse logistics adoption firms performance in measuring firms performance essential recognize multidimensional nature performance construct cameron chakravarthy previous research testing relationship firms strategy performance suggested include multiple performance measures such measures could include traditional accounting measures sales growth market share profitability other nonfinancial considerations may also used reputation public image goodwill commitment satisfaction customers lumpkin dess many benefits associated directly effective reverse logistics management these include among others improved customer satisfaction reduction inventory warehousing cost the benefits effective reverse logistics management also considered key performance measures reverse logistics program could include environmental regulatory compliance improved customers relations recovery assets products cost containment improved profitability reduced inventory investment autry et al an effective reverse logistics system could potentially increase profitability via reduced material requirements improved market share via environmental image indirect benefits reverse logistics programme better corporate image increased levels customer satisfaction may also add value jayaraman luo based arguments final hypothesis study is the level reverse logistics adoption positive impact firms performance reverse logistics pressure for adoption and the impact on firms performance methodology this study explanatory nature tries explain causal relationship four factors financial competitive pressure customer stakeholder pressure regulatory pressure corporate citizenship pressure level reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers malaysia it also tries find whether level reverse logistics implementation significant effect firms performance not in order achieve objective study quantitative research approach adopted primary data collected using survey questionnaires survey questionnaire developed based measures used previous related studies gain information level pressure faced manufacturers current level reverse logistics adoption level performance the population study consists manufacturing companies located three northern state malaysia penang kedah perlis together companies located klang valley namely kuala lumpur selangor manufacturers selected respondents study manufacturing sector major contributor malaysian economy it accounts malaysias gross domestic product gdp expected important economic growth driver tenth malaysia plan period takes the sector expected grow annually raising contribution gdp end plan period ministry finance malaysia the increase manufacturing activities however brings serious impact malaysian environmental quality the malaysia environmental quality report indicates manufacturing industries among major sources water air pollution country one possible solution reducing environmental pollution manufacturing activities reverse logistics thereby justifies selection manufacturers respondent study the sampling frame used study federation malaysian manufacturers fmm directory year manual count directory shows manufacturers located mentioned states various industries numbers manufacturers electrical electronics automotive chemicals petroleum food beverage also machinery fabricated metal industry manufacturers various different industries randomly selected allow generalisation findings towards every manufacturing sector malaysia based sample size table developed cavana delahaye sekaran number sample needed study simple random sampling method adopted selecting respondent the survey questionnaire study five different sections first section looks companys demographic information second section obtain reverse logistics activities level

considerably low mean score an item item analysis shows level investment resources overall commitment towards reverse logistics less average it shows firms really ready commit towards investing allocating extra resources reverse logistics adoption even score commitment management shows slightly higher average score it seems manufacturers ready invest allocate resources even though management company aware benefit adopting reverse logistics second two four studied variables significant relationship reverse logistics adoption level namely regulatory pressure and customer stakeholder pressure it interesting note reverse logistics adoption based study affected strongly rules regulation demanding customer stakeholder moderate influence the results demonstrated government consumer pressure groups ngos strong influence firms decision voice would lead increase likelihood adopting reverse logistics increasing current level reverse logistics activities among manufacturing firms malaysia financial competitive pressure corporate citizenship pressure significant impact reverse logistics adoption financial competitive pressure might significant effect firms competitors might also heavily involve reverse logistics activities therefore urgency respondents increase involvement reverse logistics activities corporate citizenship meanwhile important manufacturers produce consumer goods food beverages cosmetics cars producers industrial product materials components possibly respondents study manufactured consumer goods corporate citizenship significantly pressure firms increase level reverse logistics activities some authors argue reverse logistics performance could poor due fact one company may get involved reverse logistics process thus holistic approach required another reason behind reverse logistics still infancy manufacturing organizations assumed pro active role consider reverse logistics activities design phase carter ellram additionally efficient reverse logistics system much valuable company selling highvolume high value product short lifecycle retailer selling lowvalue products jayaraman luo third results also indirectly indicate level environmental awareness among consumers stakeholders malaysia improve significantly influences firms decision adopting environmental friendly logistics practices reverse logistics this evidence one item survey questionnaire our customer shareholder concern environmental protection sustainable development scores mean it shows managers involved study generally agreed fact environmental awareness among customer stakeholder days increase this phenomenon also put managers greater pressure undertake reverse logistics consequence ethical principles also feel good reverse logistics pressure for adoption and the impact on firms performance way satisfying customers stakeholders finally study examines impact reverse logistics adoption level firms performance perceived respondents the output data analysis stage shows significant relationship level reverse logistics adoption performance this finding indicates reverse logistics programs according managers manufacturing firms malaysia contributes towards improvement firms performance even whole model study according pls analysis explains variance firms performance low it means many factors determine level performance opinion malaysian manufacturers besides adoption reverse logistics the possible explanation finding may related back previous discussions regulatory pressure together consumer stakeholder pressure significant influence reverse logistics adoption level the fact reverse logistics adoption level influence performance observed possibly lack true commitment manufacturers implementing reverse logistics they implement part business strategy order improve level customer service improve quality increase revenue provide environmental protection reduce costs merely response external pressures furthermore like many logistics supply chain strategy information technology adoption management technique implementation performance outcomes related reverse logistics programs may remain sub par without appropriate resource commitment skinner bryant richey reverse logistics activities recycling refurbishing remanufacturing repackaging require significant resources commitment company want reclaim value product returns the level resources allocated reverse logistics activities manufacturers also less average mean score item shown table before therefore assumed among reason reverse logistics according study contribute much towards performance company although previously highlighted literatures state reverse logistics helps improve firms performance also similar study shows disagree result similar study survey conducted eyefortransport example reveals hightech manufacturing companies split seeing reverse logistics cost centers support product sales competitive differentiators only companies involved study able apply services profit centers suggesting hightech manufacturing companies able generate revenue reverse logistics this finding indicates majority respondents see reverse logistics source revenue consequently improve firms performance contributions limitations and future research there number significant contributions study academia business practitioners reverse logistics despite practical uses many manufacturers developed countries still popular practice among malaysian manufacturers the main factors results adoption reverse logistics barriers create low adoption level seldom explored within available literature therefore results study fulfil gap literature answering research questions factors increase level adoption barriers contributes totally non minimum level adoption nik ab halim nik abdullah sabariah yaakub reverse logistics activities only regulatory pressure together customer stakeholder pressure found significant relationship level reverse logistics adoption issues lack awareness knowledge reverse logistics implementation cost high lack resources management commitment among top barriers inhibit effective reverse logistics activities implementation among manufacturers at time study also contributes literature providing insights impact reverse logistics adoption firms performance even though finding hypothesized shed lights malaysian manufacturers view factors determine business performance the fact reverse logistics considered contributors towards firms performance means malaysian manufacturers still behind compared manufacturers developed countries treats reverse logistics anew source core competency according rogers lembke benardino managers broadened perspective difference products success and profitability failure todays competitive environment depends end life managed finally study contributes literature reverse logistics adoption specifically within context developing countries like malaysia most studies reverse logistics adoption date conducted developed countries united states united kingdom australia europe for practitioners findings study could provide management company especially manufacturer better understanding reverse logistics adoption especially factors influence adoption those never know activities related reverse logistics better understanding concept manufacturing firms particular would able address main concerns looking findings study decide proceed adoption reverse logistics programmes findings discussions study could also serve guide business managers policy makers malaysia creating policies related reverse logistics sustainable development even environmental protection this study clearly shows strict regulation strong pressure customer stakeholders increase environmental awareness managers tendency implement reverse logistics among manufacturers this study also found managers involved view reverse logistics mean improve business performance significant relationship evidence product returns reverse logistics activities always viewed cost centre manufacturers source competitive advantage therefore less attention resource allocation given reverse logistics activities in contrast manufacturers developed countries discussed literature review already reap advantage implementing reverse logistics reduction logistics costs increase profit better environmental regulation compliance improve goodwill therefore efforts taken relevant government agencies training centres educational institutions enlighten malaysian manufacturing firms managers potential adopting comprehensive reverse logistics activities there issues arise study could provide opportunity research first data collected study small due cost time constraint the sample size survey manufacturers another research greater sample size replicate survey using different sample companies sectors service reverse logistics pressure for adoption and the impact on firms performance sector may conducted validate findings moreover study categorized sample based level adoption high reverse logistics adoption level low level adopters also nonadopters refine test model this probably contributes variation reverse logistics adoption various industries finally study includes manufacturing industries sizes industry the replication study analysis conducted based specific industry sizes company would
