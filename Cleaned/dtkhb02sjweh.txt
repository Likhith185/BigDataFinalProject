previous study had however study left several important questions unanswered well one issue concerns fact schnall et al distinguished highstrain versus no highstrain conditions only although practice consistent karaseks juxtaposition two job types disregards fact demandcontrol model includes passive active job types well an interesting question therefore whether moredetailed distinctions made

positive answer question would strengthen case reasoning worker health affected causally characteristics work envi ronment finally ambulatory blood pressure single outcome variable included schnall et

for third question change reported expo sure demands control linked objective change work environment studies examined longitudinal effects changes expo sure demands control generally failed explore causes underlying change selfreported exposure demands control see the explanatory dependent variables stud ies may therefore confounded due common meth od variance related methodological artifacts
