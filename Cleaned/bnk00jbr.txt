fully appreciated the contribution study reexamines relationship satisfaction performance clari fies confusion surrounding examining relationship longitudinal setting specifically theoretical

aggregate explore three major relationships figure highlights relationships relationship customer satisfaction profits relationship employee satisfaction profits re lationship customer satisfaction employee satis faction customer satisfaction profits mixed results found relationship customer satisfaction bottomline performance given time period intuitively seems relationship positive higher customer satisfac tion favorable performance measures in fact researchers nelson rust zahorik rose batalden siemanski found positive relation ship exists shown holds profitability measuresearnings net revenues return assets however many researchers drawn opposite conclu sions schneider review article service quality profits surmises customer servicequality percep tions satisfaction sometimes always reflected profits tornow wiley found negative correla tion customer satisfaction gross profits in an study wiley concluded dimensions customer satisfaction related negatively financial perfor mance although findings might seem counterintuitive closer examination may surprising in given time period multitude factors could mask true relationship constructs for example business might decide increasing customer satisfaction important so spend large sum money implement this this could result high customer satisfaction lower profit or perhaps severe weather might keep large number customers homebound several weeks although customers venture could satisfied overall sales might poor conversely internal costcutting measures might taken make firm seem profitable given time period even customers satisfied satisfaction profitability busn res given fact many actions firm beyond scope customer satisfaction tremendous impact profits given time period significant positive relationship previously discussed seems exception rule therefore given equivocal findings insignificant relationship hypothesized there insignificant relationship profit sales time period customer satisfaction time period although conclusions concern relationship customer satisfaction financial performance con clusions also drawn concerning relationship customer satisfaction nonfinancial performance tornow wiley uncovered positive relationship customer satisfaction nonfinancial performance measures rightthefirst time customer retention this opposite conclusion concerning financial per formance schneider also found positive relationship customer satisfaction performance nonfi nancial measures considered furthermore cronin taylor explored rela tionship service quality customer satisfaction subsequent effects purchase intentions concluded perceived service quality leads satisfaction satisfaction turn significant positive effect pur chase intent dabholkar thorpe rust zahorik oliver swan bearden teel labarbera mazursky swan trawick oliver swan also found support relationship satisfaction purchase intentions boulding kalra staelin zeithaml examined effects perceived service quality behavioral intention expectations delivered service influenced perceived service quality turn impact behavioral intentions willingness provide favorable wordof mouth engage repeat business it is therefore hy pothesized that there positive relationship customer sat isfaction time period behavior intent time period employee satisfaction profits equally mixed results found concerning relationship customer satisfaction profits mixed results also found concerning relationship employee sat isfaction profits when examining relationship schneider drew conclusion almost identical conclusion concerning relationship customer satisfaction profitability frequently always em ployee data reflected unit profitability paradisetornow concluded overall employee satisfaction positively related financial performance measures satisfied employees one could argue motivated harder working dissatisfied ones this effort reflected companys performance however researchers failed replicate find ings similar crosssectional studies for example tornow wiley found consistent negative relationship employee satisfaction with items pay benefits gross profit furthermore wiley concluded relationship overall em ployee satisfaction financial performance virtually nonexistent he did however find negative relationship financial performance employees satisfaction training standard processes just customer satisfaction financial performance true relationship employee satisfaction financial performance may also masked number factors given time period employees might happy company invested money employee benefits improvements impact employee customer resulting shortterm profit reduction or economic downturn employees might happy even job time sales down thus given equivocal findings following hypothesis proposed there insignificant relationship em ployee satisfaction time period profitsales time period customer satisfaction employee satisfaction the relationship customer satisfaction employee satisfaction one relationship seem yield conflicting results in summary research date schneider concluded employee customer sat isfaction positively correlated this positive correlation holds across numerous industries consumer businesstobusiness settings schlesinger zornitsky found relationship gets stronger employees increase tenure this relationship explicitly explored tor wiley wiley almost identical findings strong relationship found customer satisfaction employee satisfaction satisfaction measured serviceoriented aspects company this surprising given employees customers usually involved coproduction services however satisfaction concerning things pay benefits measured employee standpoint weak relation ship found customer satisfaction employee satisfaction schneider colleagues reinforce positive relationship employee satisfaction customer satisfaction specifically employees reported service priority respective companies spoke positively companies human resource practices busn res bernhardt et al customers reported higher service quality also employee behavior could predicted customer perceptions customer behavior could predicted employee percep tions therefore following hypothesis proposed the goal paper reexamine crosssectional hypotheses focus previous research customer satisfaction extend previous research use time series analysis there positive relationship customer sat isfaction time period employee satisfaction method time period longitudinal view as previously suggested conflicting relationships customer satisfaction performance profits sales employee satisfaction performance may attributable fact studies crossfirm data collected one point time crosssectional data analyzed cross firm data time timeseries data examined date positive relationship customer satisfaction performance may appear shortrun examination crosssectional data the relationship may become apparent use timeseries data zeithaml parasuraman berry pp this rationale applies relationship employee satis faction profits often efforts increase employee satisfac tion bring immediate increase profits eventuate profits schneider timeseries data unique allow firm compare time notice impact satisfaction alone performance assuming factors location change time crosssectional data hand misleading point firm comparing firms whose performance may fluctuate factors satis faction alone eg location traffic promotional considera tions weather conditions the use crosssectional data also reflects fact shortrun costs often incurred trying improve satisfaction in long run impact costs softened in addition may take time companys efforts increase customer satisfaction rewarded con sumer behavior as stated customer satisfaction behavioral intention positively related however con sumers behavioral intention may carried future time periods although consumers satisfaction time period impact behavioral intention time period may impact behavior and result financial performance firm time period therefore purported true impact satisfaction performance measures apparent taking cross sectional approach longitudinal view seems necessary hypotheses captures longitudinal orientation there positive relationship change customer satisfaction previous time periods change current profitssales the data study come three independent sources consist customer satisfaction employee satisfaction performance information national chain fast food restaurants collection data spurred restaurant chains initiative customeremployee satisfactionmeasurement program one compo nent overall quality audit the first set data concerning customer satisfaction comes series surveys conducted local restau rant chain customers restaurants sur veyed time period march march the total sample size the surveys conducted restaurant every month approximately questionnaires per restaurant per data collection period ob tained the data collection conducted national mar keting research firm professional interviewers used collect data sampling procedure used en sured various days week times day represented approximate proportion sales volume customers approached finished

satisfaction overall satisfied visit today evaluation restaurant series nine quality attributes eg please rate todays visit restaurant factors listed below providing fast service cleanliness etc intention visit restaurant future based todays visit likeli hood eat future various measures time day day week to ensure high response rate important keep questionnaire short therefore demographics asked previous research conducted fastfood chain indicated little variability among key measures demo graphics thus justifying decision the second set data employees fastfood restaurant collected separately each restaurant sent package questionnaires restaurant manager asked distribute employees together postagepaid return envelope addressed independent research supplier the employees assured responses would treated anonymously and therefore asked complete questionnaire return directly total questionnaires returned res taurants average eight per store range satisfaction profitability busn

customer satisfaction scales exist both single multiitem single scale seems outperform others peterson wilson for example one satisfaction scale may increase reliability sensitivity decrase validity utility vice versa peterson wil son other researchers acknowledged similar tradeoffs choosing among satisfaction scales especially con sidering singleitem versus multiitem scale parducci schwartz
