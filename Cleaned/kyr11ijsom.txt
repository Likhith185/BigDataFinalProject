result consumers concerned business ethics furthermore firms began view gscm strategic choice streamline manufacturing distribution processes increase bottom line gscm focuses embedding efficiency supply chain waste reduction product service innovation necessitates joint supply chain efforts suppliers distributors customers since gscm involves transferring green knowledge standardising production delivery processes success joint efforts among supply chain partners highly hinges tightly trust relationship woven securely product risk information shared among partners although prior research sustainability delved issues product design producers responsibility environmental policy studies investigated role trust information sharing aligning gscm orientation supply chain this study aims investigating two research questions does implementation gscm positively affect firm performance do trust information sharing play positive role enhancing firm performance the first research question purposes ascertain whether gscm associated firm performance the positive influence green management reported mainly europe north america van hock rao holt vachon klassen markley davis studies show impact asia the second research question touches information sharing practices gscm although prior research recognised information sharing underpinning enabler supply chain management panteli sockalingam li lin cheng et al markley davis hansmann cludia madu research dealt general information sharing few studies differentiated risk green supply chain management orientation information sharing general information sharing investigated differing roles this research makes three important contributions first study provides framework understanding green management increases firm performance trust information sharing perspective this paper defines green management orientation supply chain context examines impact firm performance mediated trust information sharing second study takes deeper look information sharing general information sharing drawn much attention various contexts product design organisational behaviour in addition general information sharing study sheds light significance risk information sharing impact performance third research pays close attention firm performance firm performance classified three subconstructs customer performance operational effectiveness financial performance these differentiated performance measures help grasp impact green management orientation details we believe empirical study companies south korea also shows glimpse green management penetration asia the remainder paper structured follows section develops theoretical model hypotheses section presents research methodology regarding data collection process analysis

customers build mutual trust when comes green management context top managers make strategic decisions however trust relationship established first share confidential critical information partners since green management decisions often strategic green supply chain management orientation nature managers tend make core information available partners unless already accumulated high level trust partners discussions recent environmental regulations initiated many parts world customers interests green environment directed firms approach green supply management strategic perspective green management another stringent directive demands capability provide manufacturers consumers incentives minimise wastes maximise sustainability firms attempted curtail wastes pollutants embedding environmentfriendly design process product development phase required substantive planning collaboration far ahead product design stage this collaborative strategic partnership upstream downstream supply chain partners aims improve economic environmental performance supply chain time ansari bell this study defines gscm orientation verifies whether helps firms improve financial organisational performance we posited partners trust information sharing mediating impact gscm orientation six hypotheses developed analysed using data korean firms the results stress two things first green management improves firm performance although green management reportedly positive influence firm performance requires firms reshape organisational culture green efficiencyfriendly furthermore implementing gscm demands firms invest resources minimising pollutants wastes expanding managerial expansions recyclability products this demands neither minor effort little commitment such commitment makes firms reluctant shift green management this research shows green orientation results positive influence increasing firm performance including customer service operational effectiveness financial outcomes second trust information sharing mediates influence gscm orientation firm performance this study shows building trust relationship precedes information sharing among partners this result contradicts notion trust among organisations accumulated information actively shared among partners the additional analysis exhibited information sharing help cultivating trust relationship when comes green management information sharing strategic matter to ensure green knowledge transfer trust relationship built first this study also makes three contributions extant literature first study extended scope green management study defining gscm orientation examining impact firm performance the empirical results confirmed green management increases firm performance second study showed noticeable relationships among partner trust information sharing performances cultivating trust relationship among suppliers distributors customers helps firms deliver spread green management orientation throughout supply chain third research enriched information sharing practices firm performance green management perspective information sharing classified risk information sharing product information sharing performance differentiated customer service performance operational effectiveness financial performance the interaction jh kim et al among variables gives detailed understanding impact green management orientation implications future research implications green supply chain management from results study draw several insights conducing gscm first higher green management orientation higher three dimensions firm performance ie customer service operational effectiveness financial performance despite financial burdens conducting gscm firm performance increases green orientation effectively implemented considering empirical study based south korean firms finding indicates firms awareness green movement spreading eastern asia firms actively reacting green pressure second implementing green management requires important information partners effecting information sharing and thereby enhancing partner trust it general product information sharing risk information sharing improves firm performance this result offers managers insight corroborating trust relationship among partners paves way information sharing way around implications managers for managers research suggests solid trust relationship need established tested among supply chain partners course pursuing gscm strategically defining nature partner relationships helps firms determine degree collaboration information sharing this insight may help managers clear concerns making investments environmental issues partners it desirable firms maintain tight partnerships since environmental issues often occur sporadically unexpectedly thus building green supply chain changing supply chain culture longterm collaboration indeed takes long time build trust supply chain network by entering trust relationship supply chain partners firms cultivate organisational culture confidential sensitive information securely transferred shared in regard going green changing supply chain rather changing management tool future research direction past researches sustainability studied issues product design producers responsibility this research shed light process increasing environmental performance trust information sharing perspective as firms broaden common understanding environmental issues enrich trust relationship information sharing strategic partners reflect environmental concerns together improve green performance better while environmental management researches mainly dealt environment policy regulation financial performance research added another perspective literature relationship information sharing standpoint since study based south korean firms need confirm green supply chain management orientation research framework broader region it also interesting see differences various contexts bring trust information sharing for example automobile industry supplier could supply components one manufacturer in case could risky share confidential green knowledge suppliers in cocopetition situation building trust relationship may easy information sharing practices may take different forms future research may explore various aspects gscm references ansari ls bell je target costing the
