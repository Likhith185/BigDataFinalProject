with respect comparisons made researchers used relatively large sample sizes focusing cost profit technical efficiency measures it argued efficiency measures fail capture goals objectives enterprises gordon cormier gordon boland examples efficiency measure failures exclusion externalities ignoring longerterm social goals minority employment while privately owned profitoriented company may able ignore externalities social goals accountability publicly owned enterprises north america makes vulnerable criticism management ignores goals given social setting measurement effectiveness meeting social goals privately owned publicly owned enterprises seems appropriate the purpose study examine three electric utilities two publicly owned one privately owned the basis examination legitimacy theory employing small sample casetype approach rather large sample sizes often used in particular interested types annual report disclosures made differentiate publicly owned privately owned enterprises while traditional efficiency measures examined also examine effectiveness measures included effectiveness measures environmental social disclosures found annual reports by examining companies format begin development framework involving effectiveness measures evaluation private versus public firms one type research employs small samples case study research in research authors examine facts surrounding one situations use qualitative analysis opposed predominant quantitative analysis as bonoma states growing number researchers economics sociology psychiatry advocated helped foster rebirth qualitative research social sciences organizational behavior medicine bonoma also notes dissatisfaction application quantitative research methods strategies emerged particularly applied phenomena easily operationalized easily observable outside natural settings occur in particular think effectiveness measures firm performance easily operationalized ie quantified studied awareness context however case study small sample size research need limited qualitative research as yin indicates various quantitative analyses may also used help describe explain findings research thus paper three companies studied using qualitative information quantitative analysis downloaded university north carolina charlotte at february pt social environmental reporting the paper presented five sections the second section presents discussion three bodies literature organizational legitimacy theory environmental accounting research proprietary information costs the organizational legitimacy theory indicates legitimation government owned enterprise might different privately owned company the environmental accounting research provides evidence enterprises size important variable disclosures related effectiveness measures the proprietary information costs literature outlines risk faced firm capital markets affects reporting strategies the third section describes three companies examined paper well regulatory environments in fourth section two additional pieces quantitative evidence used make comparisons three companies finally conclusion limitations presented three bodies literature the three bodies literature described relevant visibility accountability issue legitimacy theory literature indicates attention paid companies visible rely political social support one findings environmental accounting research size company matters if hypothesized larger companies greater visibility politically sensitive smaller firms watts zimmerman larger companies would expected make disclosures these disclosures turn may affect capital markets represent one potential place firms issuing debt equity visible this would follow whether companies privately publicly owned legitimacy theory legitimacy theory rests concept organizations contracts society fulfilling contracts legitimates organizations actions as outlined rousseau social contract association people or organizations enter freely enhance societys overall welfare these contracts used basis inclusion social preferences corporate actions shocker sethi mathews where organization successful meeting contracts leads congruence organization society dowling pfeffer pp indicated organizations may take certain actions become legitimate maintain legitimacy first organization adapt output goals methods

identified symbols values institutions strong base social legitimacy organization attempt legitimacy second downloaded university north carolina charlotte at february pt aaaj gray et al outlined lindbloms description legitimacy theory according gray et al lindblom refined organizations may react legitimacy concerns employing four strategies these strategies related dowling pfeffers three actions for example lindblom stated organization may take measures educate society changes organizations actions relates dowling pfeffers first action the second strategy alter society perceives organizations actions without making changes actions dowling pfeffers second action third strategy one manipulation organization attempts divert societys attention away issues concern alternative issues dowling pfeffers third action lindbloms final strategy organization seeks alter societys expectations relates dowling pfeffers second action accounting financial reporting represent ways organization communicates society stakeholders thereby legitimating actions brown deegan pointed legitimacy theory basis several studies social responsibility environmental disclosures used annual

environmental disclosure they found increased print media attention resulted higher levels environmental disclosure using mail survey cfos coupled content analysis cfos companies environmental reports wilmshurst frost found significant correlations factors managers rated important companies environmental disclosures these authors concluded limited support legitimacy theory explanation relationship managers decision processes environmental disclosures made companies savage et al explored disclosures made two canadian pulp paper companies using legitimacy theory framework pulp paper companies environmental disclosures explained social contract perspective this accomplished classifying disclosures symbolic versus substantive legitimations falconbridge canadian company used buhr test whether legitimacy theory political economy theory better explained companys sulphur dioxide emissions disclosures year period overall findings legitimacy theory offered better explanation buhr found disclosures motivated falconbridges use technology rather use annual report device corporate viewpoint social political economic points the studies cited point focused privately owned corporations thus effect government ie public versus private ownership legitimacy setting deserves examination dowling pfeffer indicated while legitimacy constraint organizations likely affects organizations others this organizations considerably visible organizations depend relatively heavily social political support government owned enterprises would certainly seem fit second point since exist due social political support as well government owned enterprises may visible hence vulnerable political sense government accountability often election issue research environmental accounting reporting environmental accounting research examined various aspects disclosure process some studies focussed firms disclose for example rezaee et al gamble et al addressed disclosures required regulators accounting standard setters the findings studies critical present mandated disclosures either specifically address issue environmental reporting rezaee et al downloaded university north carolina charlotte at february pt aaaj result insufficient information meet users needs gamble et al while regulators standard setters serve motivators disclosure information motivations also examined the motivations studied environmental reporting range legitimacy theory eg parker deegan gordon brown deegan stakeholder theory eg roberts political economy theory tinker et al role public external pressure patten neu et al walden schwartz information costs benefits cormier magnan the overall conclusion articles interest groups stakeholders society influence types timing firms disclosures other researchers studied different aspects environmental disclosure for example studies addressed relationship environmental reporting to environmental performance wiseman ingram frazier fekrat et al ilinitch et al market belkaoui freedman stagliano blacconiere patten little et al cormier magnan users buzby falk rockness tilt an overall conclusion studies environmental reporting effect effects vary due factors industry types disclosures made examined researchers also firms making environmental disclosures freedman jaggi examined characteristics environmental disclosing firms compared nondisclosing firms two studies barth et al li et al focussed determines disclosure environmental liabilities firms from studies one important characteristic emerges firm size seems influence amount environmental disclosures made important present study idea environmental reporting often takes qualitative form eg see wiseman qualitative disclosures easily related companys effectiveness ie getting job done efficiency ie comparison inputs used outputs for reason environmental reporting used basis comparison companies studied proprietary information costs in paper contend firms environmental disclosures related proprietary costs verecchia scott proprietary costs arise due existence proprietary information proprietary information private information valuerelevant price firms shares debt traded capital markets this information known managers downloaded university north carolina charlotte at february pt social environmental reporting unknown investors information made public this lack disclosure occurs even though disclosure found benefit firms lower costs in easier access to capital markets eg botosan the potential decreased future cash flows provides one explanation nondisclosure proprietary information dye as noted cormier magnan proprietary information may used third parties eg employees customers suppliers competitors enhance positions visaá vis disclosing firm contract negotiations competitive situations from management perspective nondisclosure proprietary information result lower third party costs as one type proprietary information environmental disclosures may represent significant costs firm made publicly available where costs excluded financial statements may affect share prices debt contracts well firms reputation subsequently disclosed examples proprietary information may potentially significant costs related include environmental liabilities commitments social disclosures represent additional type proprietary information these disclosures indicate various stakeholders think firm ought doing examples type proprietary information include number minorities hired employee training costs well money spent regional development failure disclose information may due unsatisfactory record if unsatisfactory record later disclosed may prove costly firm capital markets due decreased reputation thus social environmental disclosures avoided managers perception associated proprietary costs high in situations managers access information investors not information asymmetry exists grossman milgrom nondisclosure may influence investors assume worst firm causing investors bid stock price require interest rate premium debt alternatively investors may seek collect information rational investor would expected seek information enough time money exists benefits information gathering expected exceed costs information gathering process individual collection information may inefficient societal perspective diamond scarce resources ie time money used collect information many times in situation firms voluntary disclosure information efficient way meet investors needs atiase lang lundholm firms incentive reduce information asymmetry rely capital markets gibbins et al frankel et al reduce perceived riskiness hence cost capital botosan where firms rely capital markets either debt equity financing reliance capital markets downloaded university north carolina charlotte at february pt aaaj associated environmental social disclosures scott cormier magnan legitimacy theory environmental reporting proprietary information costs literatures lead conclusion firms ownership structure size relative firms industry risk faced capital markets affect reporting strategies publicly owned firms expected face greater pressures privately owned firms disclose additional information due visibility accountability issues resulting large number stakeholders this large number stakeholders means benefits disclosure likely outweigh associated costs publicly owned firms publicly owned firms therefore expected provide social environmental disclosures privately owned firms where difference size firms industry expectations firms provide social
