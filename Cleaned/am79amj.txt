academy management journal september secretary commerce kreps social activities report developed corporations as yet course neither us government accounting profession required annual report however time may far firms dealing us government may even social accounting report affirmative ac tion activities although literature corporate social responsibilities substantial measurement branch organizational research undeveloped comparison measurement areas there two basic difficulties measuring corporate social involvement pur poses research the first unavailability detailed information quantitative monetary forms terms social activities relevance general rubric social responsibilities for pur poses research furthermore activities must measured reported consistently across large number firms order enable statistical analyses the second difficulty methodology must devised researchers measure full impact known corporate ac tivities society whereas first problem one enlisting full cooperation tiie firms obtain information latter one scientific knowledge responsibility researchers business system corporations as result combined effects two factors prospects promising near future developing measures social activities convincing useful policy purposes registering linkage corpora tion society an adequate measure corporate social activities must based method data collection investigator researcher public in terest group governmental agency corporate researcher etc unrestricted access data full range activities firm the contents scale must independently defined must measure form behavior policy interest this equivalent social survey typically used social research except unit analysis organization individual although sources present three types published research at tempt derive usable measures corporate social activities social ac counting reputational scales content analysis corporate publications whereas accounting traditionally considered body tech niques recording financial transactions firm goal social accounting add categories pertaining social impact firm firms formalized accounting system but ramanathan notes comprehensive analysis social impact private enterprise suffers present time general absence reliable data ag gregate social costs benefits business it thus must acknowledged social accounting stage results used decision

ernst ernst george steiner ucla business society several consulting firms however report clearly indicates primary difficulty developing social audit professional level formulating methods obtaining quantitative measurements social ac tivities impacts the state art present developed categories activities need measurement become aware problems obtaining quantified data the reputational method commonly used social research obtain response public social phenomenon second source data corporate social responsibilities limited scales derived responses two groups business students corporate staffers heinze reports student survey made the national association concerned business students polled graduate students regarding social involvement sample large corporations the results published originally the responses registered likerttype scale ranging very poor outstanding no opinion assigned zero the mean score reputed corporate involvement score of corporations heinze reported xerox highest score standard oil california steel bethlehem steel lower end there thus vyas substantial variation scores vance reported applica tion methodology using corporate staffers obtain ratings major corporations the study conducted ibm upper end standard oil california bethlehem steel lower end basic difficulty use reputational method studying cor porate social involvement respondents providing ratings must position detailed information corporations sample what studied actually image corporation highly influenced corporations size age access mass media well experience respondent business world changes corporate names mergers reasons also complicating factor how much confidence thus put knowledge inner workings large corporation outside public second basic difficulty reputational method limits number corporations rated it easily possible example ask respondents assess objects this may accomplished minutes time may achieved one two page question naire the respondents may even
