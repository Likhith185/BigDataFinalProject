research foundation university aarhus gratefully acknowledged the usual disclaimer applies motivation introduction it established fact high levels job turnover worker flows firms many oecd countries thus davis haltiwanger report worker turnover rates manufacturing industry usa albæk sørensen show similarly high turnover denmark werwatz et al shown manufacturing industry high turnover rates industries average turnover rates almost higher manufacturing others lower furthermore common finding job creation firms achieved simultaneous hiring firing process and similarly job destruction happens also simultaneous hiring firing high levels worker turnover persistent feature many firms this important firms associated costs benefits direct costs related newly hired reported surveys annual base salary on top comes presumably indirect costs turnover related disturbance organizational structure benefits firm employing someone new human capital lazear the view many years wages quit rates jointly determined firm according view firm takes given relationship wages quit rates revealed worker chooses wagequit set maximizes profit parsons to knowledge empirical studies attempt estimate total effects turnover profit one reasons task would highly data demanding thus sufficient use data firm performance turnover firms use wages wage policies management tool restrain increase turnover and wages impact firm performance with new dataset covering danish firms work places show impact different turnover wage policies performance large number firms thus overcoming problems controlling heterogeneity turnover dealt different strands management economics literature the literature resource based firms includes assets capabilities organizational processes firm attributes information knowledge etc controlled firm these resources used conceive implement strategies barney barney focuses different resources firm physical capital human capital becker organizational capital hr focus mitchell tomer turnover plays prominent role latter high turnover means human organizational capital may quickly eroded transformed newcomers even respect physical capital turnover employees play role utilization physical capital depends experience work force the consequence course firms use substantial resources controlling regulating turnover the human capital view turnover closely related idea firmspecific human capital the firmspecific capital worker has bigger loss firm worker quits the costs emerge time hiring new employee since costs time quitting sunk as consequence firm expected let wage profile increase worker reflecting potential loss firm worker leaves to extent reflect accumulation firmspecific human capital the firm match capital accumulation completely worker cannot obtain high level wage another firm by moving worker loses relatively high wage current firm accept much lower starting wage another firm therefore worker reluctant change job one way retaining worker pay wage increases number years firm the wage scale could even created wage starts level lower alternative wage increases level person end career paid marginal productivity this often called backloaded wage profile however using increasing wage profile retain workers moderated union pressure compressed wages one expect firms expected larger screening advertising costs also willing pay largest wage premia prevent turnover cyclical effects also effect turnover ehrenberg smith thus workers higher probability quitting relatively easy obtain better job quickly this happen labour market tight when market loose one expect quit rate small an alternative perspective value firm flow new workers entering bring new ideas new knowledge new resources them the knowledge form general human capital obtained school firms in order get room new workers older workers may sacrificed net hire new employees cannot happen part expansion however laying many old workers mean strategy retaining workers less credible firm therefore pay higher premiums wants retain the firm also reluctant layoff workers possess larger amount firm specific capital wage wage compression lower value marginal product efficiency wage theories suggest higher wage rate less likely firings reduced shirking workers simply run risk getting fired furthermore backloaded wagetenure profile may induce selfselection high productivity workers jobs finally high wage level means firm easily hire new people consequently choosy layoff people early stage careers the argument applies workers since wages relatively low beginning careers means lose less change job low tenure search theory gives similar predictions here workers search jobs worker receives job offer better current job quits therefore higher wage level current job lower probability quit match theory says workers high match quality less likely quit lower match quality this consequences quitting behaviour different persons also mean people job long time likely stay the recent theoretical empirical background present study growing literature different dimensions personnel composition it well documented exist large differences firms regard pay
