innovation additive solu tions eg smokestack scrubbers integrated pro duction processes substitution inputs optimization production reclamation outputs as result ecoprocess innovation modiﬁes organizations operation processes systems decreases unit costs production produces new signiﬁcantly improved ecoproducts reduces environmental impacts negny et al in contrast ecoproduct innovation introduction new signiﬁcantly improved products regarding charac teristics improvements technical components materials pujari ecoproduct innovation usually inspired advanced eco technologies shortening product life cycles increasing competition carrillohermosilla et al the environmental impact ecoproduct innovations stems use eg fuel consumption co emissions cars disposal eg heavy metals batteries rather production ac cording pujari et al product life cycle analysis involves aspects product creation use disposal this concept applied ecoproduct innovations for instance electricity produced wind power example use creation the compact ﬂuorescent bulb another example en ergy chloroﬂuorocarbonfree air conditioner considered green pri marily due reduced disposal impact in short ecoproduct innovations aim reducing environmental impacts ecoproducts entire life cycle christensen product saving use finally according birkinshaw et al eco organizational innovation refers upgrading organizations management processes new eco method business practices ecoorganizational innovations thus improve busi ness performance supporting necessary changes reducing administrative transaction costs improving workplace satis faction reducing costs supplies cruz et al eco organizational innovation generally reduce environ mental impacts directly facilitates implementation eco process ecoproduct innovations murphy gouldson kemp arundel summarized eco innovations include ecotraining programs eco organizational ccj cheng et al journal cleaner production product design programs ecolearning techniques creation management teams deal eco issues thus eco organizational innovations related administrative efforts toward renewing organizational routines procedures mecha nisms systems produce ecoinnovations end cruz et al in summary ecoprocess innovations directly related operations activities ecoorganizational innovations indirectly related organizations basic work activities infrastructure eventually affect entire management sys tems in addition ecoproduct innovations viewed creating new products aimed satisfying market needs eco process innovations concerned introducing new tech niques production operations while relationship three types ecoinnovation might discussed individ ually knowledge studies speciﬁcally examine formation different types ecoinnovation whole the next section discusses relationships rela tive impact ecoinnovation type business performance accordingly research model several hypotheses developed theoretical development resourcebased view rbv provides good theoretical basis discuss contribution resources capabilities perfor mance aforementioned three types eco innovation speciﬁcally theories shed light relations
