although former relates structure networks determining person maintains contact latter focuses quality relationships moran in sense higher degree proximity familiarity relationships greater transfer resources tacit knowledge complex knowledge in circumstances managers willing support motivate innovative activities providing necessary backing entrepreneurs transform ideas successful projects morans results suggest relational dimension inﬂuences innovation tasks structural dimension thus research focuses relational aspect social capital other researchers highlighted importance relational side social capital innovation tsai ghoshal demonstrate relational dimension positively inﬂuences resource exchange coordination among people involved which time creates value ﬁrm effect product innovation moreover lee wong chong state relational dimension characterized the international journal human resource management high levels trust friendship makes people willing engage social exchange cooperative interaction involves eg relying others asking help spontaneous conversations unplanned meetings sharing information knowledge resources given social capital theory emphasizes friendship trust relational dimension quality communication important determinant watson papamarcos in sense research ﬁeld highlighted role communication information gathering organizational innovation monge cozzens contractor subramaniam youndt argue innovation essentially collaborative effort that thus communication ﬂuid diffusion information sharing assimilating knowledge vital elements innovative capabilities similarly nahapiet ghoshal argue relational dimension social capital may represent increased willingness experiment combining different types information well develop new knowledge thus state second hypothesis hypothesis the relational side social capital innovative performance positively associated however assume social capital direct effect innovation also affects innovation effect human capital given social capital human capital aspects intellectual capital basis innovation consider potential interaction them this idea supported research innovation suggests development new products services results individual effort at individual level knowledge creative cooperation at social level leonard sensiper consequently social capital human capital improve innovative performance

justiﬁed importance human social capital obtaining innovative performance well potential social capital enhance human capital in section discuss enhance components intellectual capital implementing particular hrm practices the human capital advantage described boxall tends weaken time in words knowledge skills expertise tend become obsolete moreover managers could encourage highquality relationships social capital arise spontaneously could direct towards strategic objectives ﬁrms as argued boxall snell youndt wright companies prevent human capital becoming obsolete stimulate social capital implementing particular hrm practices employing appropriate personnel management procedures human social capital directed achieving organizational capabilities taking account value speciﬁcity employees knowledge as result knowledge updated improved disseminated within organization lepak snell currie kerrin particular hrm practices recommended enhancing social capital maintaining value uniqueness human capital however coherence among practices required rather discuss individual disconnected hrm practices focus three relevant hrm practices different orientations stafﬁng procedures personnel development use incentives form compensation lepak snell gomezmejıa balkin cardy stafﬁng practices must directed creation human social capital in ﬁrst case orientation stafﬁng procedures changes depending necessity general versus ﬁrmspeciﬁc human capital sekiguchi following lepak snell appropriate new employees selected based potential eg cognitive capacities aptitudes motivation current knowledge skills experience when selection policy applied company likely incorporate organization individuals capable learning valuable unique knowledge necessary ﬁrms competitiveness thereby building human capital advantageous company subramaniam youndt sekiguchi in case ﬁrms search incorporate employees learning potential order develop valuable unique knowledge favours innovation thus propose following hypothesis hypothesis hrm practices selection processes based employees potential learn positive inﬂuence value uniqueness human capital the stafﬁng employees valuable unique human capital enough companies must incorporate attitudes towards teamwork interpersonal adaptability similar criteria selection processes order improve social capital lengnickhall lengnickhall in study knowledgeintensive ﬁrms swart kinnie analyse hrm practices software company develops social capital enabling interconnections within knowledge pool employees their case study shows technical ability considered important element selection candidates companys culture led recruitment process once technically competent candidates identiﬁed recruits needed show would share innovative ideas cuttingedge the international journal human resource management knowhow within project team this kind practice expected affect social capital positively incorporating organization individuals interpersonal skills promoting interaction among individuals lepak snell given discussion propose following hypothesis hypothesis hrm practices selection processes based interpersonal skills positive inﬂuence social capital developmental practices speciﬁc training career management mentoring giving feedback employees improve organizations human capital as human capital theory outlined investment speciﬁc training improves individual performance also encourages career development must facilitated ﬁrm flamholtz lacey thus employees know company training programmes improve personal competence value uniqueness organizations human capital enhanced this employees tend match knowledge skills needs organization shipton dawson west patterson similarly employees offered career paths within company receive feedback concerning performance could improved valuable ﬁrmspeciﬁc knowledge generated internal development as discussed above career expectations contribute innovative behaviours enhance human capital developmental practices motivate employees create opportunities improve personal stocks knowledge skills ulrich lake snell dean lepak liao chung harden thus try conﬁrm following hypothesis slagter researchers shown hypothesis developmental hrm practices speciﬁc training career management mentoring programmes feedback appraisals positive inﬂuence value uniqueness human capital other personnel development practices delegation responsibilities involvement employees decision making also given priority this practices motivate employees share knowledge colleagues implementing type hrm practice improves organizations social capital thereby strengthening ﬂow exchange information within work groups ulrich evidence shows empowerment employee participation decision making enable formal informal work relations provide employees network use sharing information adner helfat therefore state following hypothesis hypothesis developmental hrm practices empowerment employees participation decision making positive inﬂuence social capital the last set practices compensation practices may also contribute enhancing human social capital speciﬁcally two issues important here use individual incentives new ideas teambased incentives compensation systems considered especially important employer wants employees acquire valuable unique competences considered necessary ﬁrms operations shaw gupta mitra ledford effective compensation systems work attract retain valuable employees motivate develop required competences park gardner wright the reasoning company determines valuable unique competences human resources possess decides incentives cabellomedina et al encourage acquisition development cappelli singh wright mcmahan mcwilliams therefore employees recognize assessed paid according contributions time order develop valuable unique contributions incentive acquire knowledge valuable company difﬁcult competitors duplicate baron byrne lepak snell therefore advance following hypothesis hypothesis hrm practices use individual compensation incentives positive inﬂuence value uniqueness human capital these arguments also apply teams working innovations sarin mahajan speciﬁcally barczak wilemon demonstrate members work teams strong interest remunerated according results generated teams similarly laursen laursen foss demonstrate empirically positive impact teambased pay team performance motivating tool sharing knowledge in summary use groupbased incentives may enhance cooperative behaviour increase interaction among individuals perceive part

practices enhance value human capital empowerment involvement practices improve uniqueness this interesting result suggests training career development developmental practices would provide individuals broader base knowledge increasing knowledge value favouring internal mobility nevertheless practices would lead deeper knowledge seems enhanced empowerment in sense employee empowered ﬁnd new solutions concrete issues internal work problems demands higher knowledge levels thus skills empowered employees would become rare ﬁrm speciﬁc organization fifth contrary expectations found evidence providing individual group incentives enhances either employee knowledge team knowledge leading promotion innovation possible explanation result provided amabile argues innovation requires creativity cannot generated salary incentives requires intrinsic compensatory practices similarly gupta singhal recommend companies use promotions awards rather monetary compensation reward creation new products thamhain also ﬁnds compensation little impact innovation teams these insights suggest using compensation reward innovative results rather innovative behaviour eschewing nonmonetary forms compensation diminishes innovation performance work teams furthermore predicting measuring results innovation difﬁcult using resultbased incentives may effective way motivating employees innovate all considerations help us understand role incentives activity results uncertain occurs innovation activities finally expected innovative performance positive effect ﬁrm performance this supports arguments literature favour innovation source competitive advantage despite contributions study limitations first sample size sufﬁcient allow segmentation based sectors incorporated population could
