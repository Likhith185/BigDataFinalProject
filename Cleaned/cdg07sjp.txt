civil behavior topa palací within range negative results studies shown breach contract becomes source workers burnout partly threatens predictability sense control people believe environment gakovic tetrick leiter topa morales teacher burnout decrease wellbeing caused chronic work stress characterized emotional exhaustion cynical attitude towards students diminished feeling professional efficacy although burnout seems prevalent among secondary teachers studies show frequent educational levels byrne on basis findings study predict breach psychological contract direct influence three components burnout syndrome emotional exhaustion cynicism lack professional efficacy most studies social comparison used professional groups assumed groups kind workrelated threat focus breach psychological

becoming basis researchers identify behaviors prevalent certain social contexts morrison wolfe robinson also useful employees adapt stressing situation must deal bennenbroek buunk van der zee grol on basis statements study propose breach psychological contract affect three components burnout mediated social comparison traditionally noted that threatening circumstances people tend compare situation worse downward comparison may contribute wellbeing for review see van der zee oldersma buunk bos this statement based assumption people contrast situation people process comparison leads comforting conclusion better others however studies support direction social comparison works report comparison people worse negative effects gibbons gerrard also shown that many cases people prefer contact better off partly provide useful information solve problems among others see van der zee et al topa morales and caeiro on basis evidence buunk ybema proposed identification contrast model arguing consequences social comparison depend direction comparison also psychological processes involved thus whereas means contrast people oppose situation people compare themselves means identification assume future similarity object comparison it expected that comparison better off identification comforting contrast causes unease whereas comparison worse off opposite pattern would observed van der zee buunk sanderman botke van den bergh these authors verified four proposed tendencies ultimately better classified two basic strategies social comparison tendency focus negative interpretation information means downward identification upward contrast that is identifying worse contrasting oneself better off tendency positive interpretation means identification better upward identification contrast worse downward contrast van der zee et al on basis findings study predict breach psychological contract opposite effect two basic dimensions social comparison identification contrast moreover predict two dimensions comparison opposite effect results is negative comparison positive influence emotional exhaustion cynicism lack fulfillment whereas positive comparison follow opposite pattern the predicted model represented figure summing up present study hypotheses follows we expect find direct effects breach psychological contract emotional exhaustion cynicism lack professional efficacy

subsamples displayed figures figure standardized estimations model primary education figure standardized estimations model preprimary education figure standardized estimations model secondary education topa morales and caeiro discussion most results study line hypotheses appropriateness general model perception breach psychological contract adequately predicted burnout verified moreover verified effects partially mediated social comparison firstly study found support affirmation leiter stated teacher burnout consequence breach psychological contract this statement obtained previous empirical support professional collectives civil servants penitentiary institutions intervention groups emergencies catastrophes topa morales tested samples teachers secondly study found empirical support theoretical affirmation processes social comparison mediate perceived breach contract results we believe first work provides data better understand processes surround employees perception organization failed satisfy promises morrison wolfe robinson this model assumes proposal relations burnout social comparison that point new studies found support idea emotional exhaustion antecedent led people social comparison brenninkmeijer vanyperen buunk buunk ybema gibbons et al however although longitudinal results required making statements causalities study tested consistent model seems show relations could go opposite direction this attempt ignore possibility process may circular increase emotional exhaustion may lead people social comparison this idea suggested authors note emotional exhaustion perception inferior others reinforce circular relation friedman farber thirdly study found global model adequate teachers various educational levels in sense despite fact work conditions may vary extent different levels seems clear determining characteristics task teaching stable when examining results detail seen that general model influence breach contract lack professional efficacy direct mediated two types social comparison negative positive these data novel cannot compared findings previous studies either resorted global measures burnout syndrome topa morales else focused exclusively aspect emotional exhaustion gakovic tetrick feasible explanation fact obvious seems logical assume professional efficacy perception established comparison ones work results results ones colleagues capable achieving and hence ones efficacy would affected social comparison perceived breach it also possible result reveal tendency examine ones levels achievement searching explanations perceived breach contract examination lead people look work environment as mentioned theoretical development morrison wolfe robinson highly likely that facing organizational breach psychological contract searching explanation disconcerting aversive fact workers engage processes appraisal contributions along processes social comparison although theoretical speculations suggested processes simultaneous relations probably complex initially assumed summing up workers perceive breach contract simultaneously ask why happening me how treating colleagues how responding organization in search answers questions social comparison provide clues appraise lack professional efficacy results colleagues achieve in sense direct relation predicted negative comparison cynicism confirmed data taking consideration preceding studies one might suppose cynicism burnout syndrome dimension weakest relation social comparison clearly represents cognitive aspects psychological wellbeing cynicism considered distant attitude towards work case burnout salanova et al whereas influence receives breach contract overwhelming lastly examining standardized estimations separate multigroup models observed that preprimary education positive negative social comparison seem little effect cynicism lack efficacy their influence considerable dimension emotional exhaustion in primary secondary education impact negative social comparison results and lesser extent positive social comparison pronounced in group primary teachers detected relation positive comparison cynicism opposite sign predicted one this also present secondary teachers although value low likewise observed results opposite direction predicted one relations positive comparison emotional exhaustion lack professional efficacy although again standardized regression weights low in case seems clear support last hypothesis partial consequences positive comparison personal results consistent expected across subsamples social comparison and perceived breach of psychological contract lastly study exestablishes importance peoples social identity regard social comparison as noted recently hogg social comparisons occurring within groups probably oriented towards reducing uncertainty rather towards emphasizing ones personal prominence moreover probably comparisons better off comparison dimension is socalled upward comparisons this could explain why models study educational level weight positive social comparison dimension made almost exclusively items downward contrasthad little influence results in contrast socalled dimension negative comparison made items upward comparisonseemed influence results the teachers within group tended compare members group mainly order reduce uncertainty looking prototypical group members referents on basis this suggest that future studies investigators explore detail relations two aspects peoples relations within groups the following two main limitations study noted use crosssectional design adequate appraise causal mechanisms relations among predictors results resorting exclusively selfreport data longitudinal studies contrasting
