effective legal systems guard unethical corporate behav iors ben brik rettab mellahi china largest emerging economy suffering shortcomings emerging markets zhou poppo imperfect policies reward firms csr efforts ineffective legal systems punish unethical practices consequently regulative institutions exert limited pressure organizations initiate csr organizations benefit little conforming regulative institutions on hand normative pressure engage csr high china the increasingly exposed unethical corporate behaviors china pose challenges entire business society make csr increasingly

questions first csr positive effect firm performance china second so competitive advantages csr provide corporate social responsibility firm performance regarding first question suspect inconsistent findings impact csr firm performance explained least partially differentiating csr activities based different stakeholders considering contingent role market environment first extant research different stakeholders perspectives recognizes stakeholders varying expectations objectives visàvis orga nizations maignan ferrell ferrell yet studies explicitly differentiate effects csr different

increase employee satisfaction commitment hansen et al motivates employees work hard deliver better products services thus increasing consumers perceived benefits in words employees motivated csr activities productivity higher generate consumer benefits thereby contributing firm performance mcwilliams siegel reynolds beatty overall propose that hypothesis marketing competence mediates relationship csr toward employees firm performance csr toward customers focuses firms voluntary consideration customer concerns goes beyond purely profitseeking behaviors it enhances firms marketing

determined customers perception product quality psychological gains homburg kuester beutin menon zeithaml csr toward customers strengthens consumers positive attitudes toward firms offerings promotes favorable benefit perception brown dacin luo bhattacharya first firm respects customer rights provides customers accurate information shows goodwill gains trust time the trusting relationship enhances

scandal exposed public greatly damage firms brand image sanlu milk scandal taken together propose that hypothesis marketing competence mediates relationship csr toward customers firm performance bai chang the moderating effect competitive intensity the bfit concept proposes organizations make strategic decisions match external environment venkatraman prescott for example effectiveness strategic orientation depends market dynamics jaworski kohli zhou li in respect argue effectiveness csr toward different stakeholders also depends market environment we consider two environmental factors competitive intensity market turbulence following reasons first competitive intensity market turbulence fundamental variables among many dimensions market environment zhou li second china experienced complex massive market structure changes economic transition hoskisson eden lau wright thus market industry structures china highly uncertain third competition intensified china number private enterprises drastically increases due transition centrally planned economy market economy competitive intensity refers degree competition organization faces within industry escalating competitive intensity marked internecine rivalry fierce price wars heavy advertising diverse product alternatives porter in environment firms two options achieving competitive advantage provide similar products lower price pressure caused price wars differentiate products offered competitors gebauer porter zhou yim tse the positive impact csr toward society marketing competence strength ened competition intense when market highly competitive customers many alternatives jaworski kohli perceived quality similarity among available brands high firms effectively differentiate brand rivals attaching socially responsible attributes corporate brand lai et al for example facing fierce competition nongfu spring bottled water company china announced company would donate one cent every bottle nongfu spring water sold help children living poverty this bone cent program differentiates nongfus brand competitors greatly increases customer satisfaction well brand image xue zhang in addition csr toward society promotes customercompany identification strengthens firms ability increase customer value du bhattacharya sen customercompany identification drives customers make certain brandspecific pur chasing decisions facing alternatives competitive market therefore firms marketing competence enhanced exercising csr toward society highly com petitive environment by contrast situation little competition effect csr toward society may salient customers many product alternatives csr toward society likely cost burden rather important differentiation strategy industry little competition we propose that hypothesis the greater competitive intensity stronger positive effect csr toward society firms marketing competence in highly competitive market marketing competence achieved providing superior products economically porter zhou et al increased corporate social responsibility firm performance competition requires firms increase efficiency productivity gebauer although csr toward employees helps firms enhance ban employers brand image turban greening increased employee satisfaction hansen et al firms likely redirect focus employee efficiency instead employee development competitive intensity high in addition csr toward employees adds costs leads higher product prices higher product pricing makes difficult attract new retain current customers therefore weakens firms marketing competence customers highly pricesensitive market many similar product offerings second csr toward employees motivates employees work hard commit employers competition creates uncertainty level commit ment when competition intense large number competitors market looking best talent in situation employees especially highlevel skills knowledge many job options may lured better offers rival firms thus turnover may problem griffeth hom gaertner maertz griffeth employees may less committed delivering customer benefits despite employers csr efforts market competition intense taken together propose that hypothesis the greater competitive intensity weaker positive effect csr toward employees firms marketing competence in intensely competitive market customers many options jaworski kohli firms must closely monitor respond customers needs ensure stay relevant porter researchers argue competition increases value generated strategy emphasizes customers becomes even important slater narver first csr toward customers represents effective way satisfy customers needs wants for example food industry customers increasingly concerned product quality especially safety ingredients product addressing customers concerns becomes critical firms highly competitive environment customers demand high quality products superior service levels homburg müller klarmann second greater competition industry firm needs embrace technological developments customer needs csr toward customers helps firms collect customer feedback identify trends changes early in competitive market emphasis customers may enhance firms ability respond preempt competitive threats timely manner kumar jones venkatesan leone strengthening competitive advantage therefore propose that hypothesis the greater competitive intensity stronger positive effect csr toward customers firms marketing competence the moderating effect market turbulence market turbulence refers extent industry environment

participants understand predict customer needs wants studying industry reports fang palmatier steenkamp however challenging firm accurately anticipate customer demand predict response marketing

however interplay market turbulence csr toward society employees may insignificant on one hand highly turbulent markets cus tomer response firms csr toward society employees difficult predict two activities provide direct value customers it possible customers respond firms societal employee welfare efforts turbulent environment since customers demands change frequently on hand although csr toward society csr toward employees help firms differ entiate brand motivate employees may help firms predict customers current future demands critical highly turbulent mar kets taken together strong theoretical justifications moderating effects market turbulence effect csr toward society marketing competence link well csr toward employees marketing compe tence link we propose that hypothesis the

for example china may lack effective legal systems guard unethical corporate behavior ben brik et al we offer refined examination csrperformance link previous studies tended treat csr unidimensional

different stakeholder groups positive effects firm performance in particular find csr toward society stronger positive effect marketing competence csr toward customers the findings challenge conventional view csr initiatives often conflict firms profitseeking activities showing positive impact csr firm performance china our results also suggest firms china comply normative institutional

competence china marketing managers bear mind performing csr activities merely cost burden viable strategy creating competitive advantage in fact many csr activities emerged recently china in chinese companies filed csr reports share information csr initiatives public csr become important part companies strategies bloomberg businessweek in addition results suggest corporate practitioners limit csr

effectiveness csr toward three stakeholder groups csr toward stakeholders suppliers government community re mains unclear since employees customers society contribute market performance maignan et al marketing competence becomes major mediator csr activities toward three groups performance however underlying mechanisms csr toward stakeholder groups affects corporate performance may different therefore second avenue research examine csr toward stakeholder groups influences firm performance find boundary conditions csr dimensions in addition multidimensional csr framework applied contexts
