lead adoption emps less effort fewer resources due competences achieved qmps already developed pereiramoliner et al therefore hypothesis proposed adoption qmps impacts positively adoption emps restaurants today companies face range complex situations including stiff competition hostile economic environment decline demand ﬁnancial downturns changes consumers behavior oconnor frew kim et al
