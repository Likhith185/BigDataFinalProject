grube journal of management vol no deephouse found minute tv show produced aired one market resulted greater change individuals beliefs attitudes behaviors comparable control market other research takes macro approach using content analyses media poll data public opinion for instance behr iyengar found lead cbs news stories inﬂation energy led increased public awareness issues twomonth period

recently agendasetting moved beyond issue salience examine media effects attitudes behaviors medias inﬂuence social construction reality gamson croteau hoynes sasson roberts smith contingencies agendasetting also identiﬁed for instance media coverage may less effect public issue obtrusive is public direct experience ader zucker and ﬁnally media affects publics agenda question determines medias agenda is media content mc combs shoemaker reese as noted above media cannot record events opinions reviewing past research mccombs ob served events opinions appearing news represented main

ﬁrms within months publication date some members public may direct knowledge opinions event issue reporters gather newspaper stories these stories may inﬂuence members public without direct experience strongly held opinions for instance knowledge opinions exxon valdez oil spill spread lived prince william sound media rest world and practical perspec tive agendasetting effects appear rapidly within

comparing media annual report attention environment multiple years whether community concern driven fairly limited time lag media attention as majority studies seem indicate whether media attention reﬂects com munity concern this minority view media coverage market driven crucial purposes in addition brown deegan fombrun shanley assumption used past management research for instance chen meindl

fombrun shanley in contracting partners good reputation provides least three valuable strategic beneﬁts allows ﬁrm lower cost allows ﬁrm increase price create competitive barriers if media reputation
