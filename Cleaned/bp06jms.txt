social externalities eg crime health subject strong regulatory regimes competition safety taxation similarly defence pharmaceutical industries receive particular attention ethical pressure groups proﬁle workplace health safety concerns relatively high construction resource extraction sectors since reputational beneﬁts improved social responsiveness arise meeting expectations stakeholders mitigation reparation social issues follows demonstrating good social performance perceived bear little relation ﬁrms activities may thought wasteful managerial excess harm reputation whereas examples
