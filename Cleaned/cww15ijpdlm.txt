value chains electronics industry exemplified services provides terms production platforms contract manufacturing centers for instance foxconn emerged industrys largest player revenue us million with new platform solution lowcost mobile devices competence upgrade taiwanbased original design manufacturers suppliers spin product divisions end markets become lead firms computer consumer electronics markets eg acer asus htc sturgeon kawakami in bureau foreign trade taiwan specified several information communications technology product categories notebook personal computers percent liquid crystal display monitors percent digital cameras percent demonstrate highest global market share terms production value moreover large number broadband communication terminals broadband access device products provided taiwanbased firms hold highest global market share terms production value including cable customer premises equipment devices percent wireless local area network devices percent personal

hypotheses corporate environmental strategy ecs competitiveness drawing upon studies vachon vachon klassen study views ecs direct involvement organization suppliers planning implementing sustainable environmentfriendly practices ecs covers following areas suppliers environmental management system product design process distribution pollution prevention because globalization production chain environmental efforts manufacturer must applied across chain action strengthens abilities manufacturing function remain green advantageous sarkis simpson et al specific manufacturing practices eg
