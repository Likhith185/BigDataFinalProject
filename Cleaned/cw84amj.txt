previous research although examination previous research does certain extent parallel work arlow gannon number studies examined herein considerably larger in addition survey earlier work pro vides rationale bulk paper namely new considerably extensive empirical test research question measurement corporate social responsibility there two generally accepted methods measuring csr the first method reputation index in method knowledgeable observers rate firms basis one dimensions social performance this method advantages first tends internally consis tent one evaluator applying albeit usually subjective criteria firm second makes pretence applying rigorous objective measure dimension may innately subjective third may summarize perceptions key constituency various firms this alone may important factor determining relationship be tween csr financial performance there are however disadvantages well the important and obvious rankings highly subjective thus may vary sig nificantly one observer another this raises spectre unreli ability second problem one sample size most reputation indexes generated date cover relatively small number firms thus one must cautious generalizing
