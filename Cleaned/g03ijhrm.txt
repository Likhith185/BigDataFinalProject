concept organizational commitment appears similar job satisfaction several distinctions made two constructs first commitment considered global concept reflecting individuals affective attachment organization whole whereas job satisfaction specific positive emotional state resulting appraisal ones job job experiences locke thus organizational commitment regarded stable time so certain transitory events may positively negatively affect individuals job satisfaction unlikely affect overall attachment organization furthermore mowday et al propose that commitment attitudes appear develop slowly consistently time individuals think relationship employer whereas satisfaction found less stable measure time reflecting immediate reactions specific tangible aspects work environment

organization negatively affected robinson et al under gouldwilliams hr practices workplace trust circumstances employees tnay feel less comtnitted disinclined exert behalf organization furthermore organizations offer shortterm employment contracts employees likely reciprocate low commitment behaviours this consistent norms reciprocity postulated that individual receives something benefit them become indebted one providing benefit causing respond kind therefore hr practices send powerful signals employees extent organization dusts lies et al guzzo noonan organizations fail deliver
