independent nonexecutive directors likely higher extent voluntary disclosure although sehk requirements emphasize number rather proportion ind total directors use proportion used current study independent directors may exert sufﬁcient monitoring power numbers account small proportion board membership the existence audit committee the functions audit committee include ensuring quality ﬁnancial accounting control system collier since audit committee consists mainly nonexecutive directors inﬂuence reduce amount information withheld agency theory predicts establishment audit

hypothesized that companies audit committee likely higher extent voluntary disclosure the existence dominant personalities firms one individual serves chairman chief executive ofﬁcer managing director

theory argues diffused ownership environment ﬁrms disclose information reduce agency costs information asymmetry in concentrated ownership situation impact voluntary disclosure complicated argu ment
